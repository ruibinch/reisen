Karakol was the next city on our tour. It was situated 400km east of Bishkek and in close proximity to the famed Issyk-Kul lake. The elevation of the city was already 1700m and it was surrounded by many mountains that offered great hiking opportunities, which was our main goal for heading there in the first place.

## Journey from Bishkek to Karakol

Kyrgyzstan does not have a good public transport system. It was partially due to the geographical constraints - how does one build train tracks in a country that is 90% covered by mountains? To travel between cities, one either drove their own car, took a taxi or took a *marshrutka*, which was a mini-van of sorts. The first was unfeasible, the second was expensive (twice the cost of a *marshrutka*), hence we decided on the third. After all, that was the method of transport used by the locals as well; why not get a short preview of their daily lives?

At the central bus station, buses and minivans of all sizes were parked haphazardly everywhere. We peered at the winDSCreen of all the vans in search of the "Karakol" sign; of course, it was in Cyrillic, so it was not "Karakol", but "Каракол".

*Not that hard to infer*

The *marshrutka* was a mini-van with about 15 seats. There were 2 seats on one end, an aisle, and then a solitary seat on the other end. The last row was a long seat that stretched the width of the van. It was a tight squeeze; there was less leg space than on a budget airplane. We boarded the van and proceeded to the last row, with the mindset that if there were only 3 people seated there, we would be afforded more space.

There is no fixed time schedule for these *marshrutkas*. Instead, it operates on a very simple if-else logic - if it is full, leave; else, wait for it to fill up. When we boarded, it was about half-full. Thankfully, we only had to wait about 15 minutes before it filled up entirely. Unfortunately, they were really adamant on filling up the van entirely. When there were already 3 of us seated on the last row, I thought that was it; to my dismay, on trooped 1 more guy in Kyrgyz army slacks who spotted the space on the last row and came to squeeze beside me. So, there were 4 of us, none whom were of small stature, squashed in the last row, shoulder-to-shoulder. I wasn't even able to stretch my legs under the seat in front of me, as my knees were so squished to the seat that I was unable to extricate them. And, although it was a distance of 400km, the journey was estimated to take 5-6 hours, due to the terrain.

Along the way, the van made a couple of stops. Whenever we got out and looked around, there were, without fail, some snow-capped mountains in the distance. Literally every rest stop, no matter at how random a place, offered a breathtaking and scenic view.

The journey did indeed live up to its estimated time, and more. It was a combination of the winding roads amidst the mountainous terrain and that some parts of the roads were not completely paved, i.e. gravel-like, which forced the van driver to slow down. All in all, it was 6.5 hours spent on a van, sitting shoulder-to-shoulder, with minimal leg room - safe to say, it was not the most pleasant journey. Then again, our 14-hour, 6-car trek from Kashgar to Osh a few days back had offered us some form of acclimatisation.

## Matsunoki

We had no planned accommodation for Karakol initially, as we had not dared to plan so far ahead right at the start. It was only on our last night in Bishkek that we searched for accommodation and made our booking. The place that we booked had a Japanese-sounding name, Matsunoki. The pictures depicted a house setting with warm lights and wooden floors - it looked fantastic. It was our most expensive stay by far at $33/night; for comparison, our hostel in Osh had cost just $8/night.

Once we stepped into the place, we were amazed. The decorations and furnishings were exactly as what had been shown in the pictures online. When we were shown to our rooms, our jaws dropped even further. The room was spacious and well-furnished, there were 3 beds as well as an attached toilet, which was by far the best-looking toilet that we had encountered on our trip. The owner was a Japanese woman and the influence manifested itself clearly - the design was reminiscent of some Japanese themes and even the toilet was a Japanese-style toilet, including features such as warming of the toilet seat and a bidet.

The next morning, when we saw the breakfast arrangement, our jaws dropped once more. It was that of a top-notch B&B and was utterly sumptuous.

## Animal Market

One of the highlights of Karakol, and one of the events that I had marked, was the Animal Market that was held every Sunday. As the name suggests, it is a market where animals are transacted - live animals, to clarify. It was the time of the week where the local farmers and animal rearers in the surrounding regions would load up their lorries with their livestock and drive down to Karakol to market their wares. Similarly, many locals would head there to peruse the available stock of animals and make purchases for the appealing candidates.

The plethora of animals over there was something to behold. There were all sorts of animals everywhere - goats, sheep, horses, cows, oxen and probably a few more that my city kid background failed to allow me to recognise. The market was a huge open area, but as we walked around, we saw that there were some segregation of animals - one area was predominantly smaller animals like goats and sheep, another was the larger animals like horses and cows. The area with horses was filled with dung everywhere; it was a literal minefield. We played "avoid the mines" for as long as we could but it was only a matter of time before we both unfortunately succumbed to the law of probability. There was a point where I had to take an abnormally large step to avoid a pile of dung but I did not witness the other pile of dung; once I placed my foot down and felt it slide, I knew what had happened and sighed. Well, it wouldn't be a complete experience of visiting an animal market without stepping into some fresh horse dung!

I witnessed some magnificent sights that I had never seen before in my life. A man carried up an entire sheep, which had its legs tied, and dumped it unceremoniously into the trunk of his car. Kids who were less than 10 years old were leading an army of goats around by pulling on a string that was tied to each of the individual goats. Horses nuzzled against one another, or against a wooden post, or basically anything that was possible to nuzzle against. As a _suaku_ city kid, it was a sight to marvel at.
