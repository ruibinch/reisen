"Let’s go to Europe!" - a phrase oft uttered by keen travellers throughout the world, and one which tends to conjure up the same images in people’s minds. Cruising down the River Thames in London, ascending the Eiffel Tower in Paris, traipsing along the canals of Amsterdam, lounging on a gondola in Venice, gazing in awe at the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona; these are the typical first impressions that people have of Europe, and these are subsequently the places that people tend to travel to.

What about Eastern Europe?

"Oh no, it’s too far", "it’s too dangerous", "too many pickpockets and gangs in the streets", "the political situation is too unstable", etc.

These are the standard stereotypes that persist of Eastern Europe till this day, despite the fall of the Iron Curtain occurring 30 years ago and that many cities have fully remade and redeveloped their image. The significant majority of travellers still neglect the eastern portion of Europe, largely due to these misconceptions. It is a huge pity that this region is not appreciated enough, as what it can offer is a tremendously unique experience compared to the relatively standard fare of town squares, cathedrals and clock towers common across numerous Western European cities.

In June 2017, I went on a 12-day trip to the Balkans, a trip which contained unprecedented spontaneity, harrowing experiences and the pleasure of meeting several kindred souls that formed indelible impressions upon me. During this period, I travelled to Bulgaria (Sofia), Bosnia and Herzegovina (Sarajevo, Mostar) and Serbia (Belgrade, Novi Sad). Each place had its own exclusive vibe that was completely disparate from one another, despite them being frequently lumped together under one overarching category, the Balkans.
