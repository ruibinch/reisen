## Background

Xinjiang is a massive autonomous region situated in the north-western part of China and the site of a wide range of habitats, from the looming Tian Shan mountain range to the barren Gobi Desert. Unfortunately, it is better known for its constant dissension rather than the natural landscape it has to offer. Xinjiang has been a conflict-ridden area for the better part of the last century and the situation looks unlikely to change for the better in the near future. On the contrary, there is a higher likelihood that it will take a turn for the worse, given the increasing crackdown on the local Uighurs and the consolidation of power by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in recent years.

Today, Xinjiang is an Orwellian state, bogged down by its draconian laws and populated with a ridiculously excessive police presence. A police post is present every 500m and authorities have the right to stop anyone along the street to request for an inspection of their ID. Security scanners are everywhere, from railway stations to shopping malls to parks. Although the population of Xinjiang constitutes 1.5% of China's population, it is responsible for 21% of the arrests made in the entire country. There are frequent reports of local Uighurs being randomly arrested and thrown into "re-education" camps, which aims to ensure that the Uighur population conforms to what the CCP deems as China principles (singing the national anthem, only allowing Mandarin as a spoken language etc). In essence, it is attempting to destroy the Uighur spirit and to quash the bubbling sentiment of the Uighur separatists, who advocate that Xinjiang should not remain a part of China.

All of the above are information that can be readily found online, and it makes for some sombre reading with significant sympathy for the repressed Uighurs. However, it is not until I went there that I realised the extent of the situation first-hand and witnessed the dire lifestyle that the Uighurs are subjected to on a daily basis.

## On the way to Ürümqi

The initial glimpse into Xinjiang-level security was witnessed at Chongqing Airport. Our flight out from Singapore followed the route of Singapore -> Chongqing -> Ürümqi via West Air China - a budget China airline mainly comprising of domestic flights, with Singapore being the sole overseas destination that it flies to. Upon arrival at Chongqing Airport, the stewardess called out "最终目的地是乌鲁木齐的乘客，清先下飞机 *(passengers who are continuing on to Ürümqi, please disembark first)*". Among the entire plane, only 3 people stood up, 2 of us along with another Chinese guy. At that moment, I finally understood why our check-in procedure at Changi Airport had taken a much longer time than usual - all 3 of us were seated in the first 3 rows near the front of the plane, which was definitely intentional with the Chongqing transit in mind.

We trooped off the plane and were brought on a merry tour around the back of Chongqing Airport; we were first escorted to a separate security check, where our passports were heavily scrutinised, before being led to an intense security screening, which required us to remove our shoes and also a large number of potentially contraband items from our bags before it could pass the security scanner. Following this excursion, which took about an hour in total, we were led out through a back exit of the terminal and instructed to wait in a van that was parked along the runway. What was going on? we wondered. We waited for a good while before the van finally moved off to another part of the runway, where we were deposited and then hurriedly directed to board a bus that was filled with waiting passengers. The bus then drove off to the plane and we were finally able to board the plane (the same plane actually). It was, without a doubt, one of the more unique transits that I have had.

## Initial glimpse

Within the first few hours alone, we got a brief glimpse into the intensive screening that occurs in Xinjiang. The points listed below are not ordered in terms of ridiculousness, but in (mostly) chronological order.

- All taxis have a grille in between the front and back seats, which makes cash payment a little troublesome as one has to contort their hand to be able to fit the notes through to the driver. However, it turns out that this is mostly a non-issue, as there is a conveniently-placed QR code at the back of the taxi for customers to pay via WeChat instead. 
- A security scanner was present right at the door of our hotel, along with a policeman stationed in the lobby and a riot vest, shield and helmet ready on a nearby table.
- We witnessed groups of policemen going up in the lift a couple of times - most probably to conduct spot checks on hotel guests.
- We attempted to purchase SIM cards but were unable to as a Chinese ID was required. Most probably so that they could link an ID to a specific SIM card for tracking purposes.
- More security scanners everywhere, even along the road at a shopping street. Imagine a security scanner set up along the pedestrian walkway at the start of Orchard Road; that was it.
- We witnessed, multiple times, police officers stopping random citizens along the street to inspect their ID. In some cases, they were led away by the police to goodness-knows-where. Of course, these inspections were only conducted on the Uighur-looking people.

If I had to find a word to summarise the situation, it would be "suffocating". By the end of the first day, I estimated that we had walked through 15 security scanners - that's 15 times of queuing up, putting down my bag on the conveyor belt, walking through the scanner, being frisked by the policeman (sometimes) and taking out my passport for them to inspect. After a few times, I resorted to keeping my passport in my jeans pocket since I had to fish it out so frequently. The repeated procedure was, simply, a burden. Of course, the frustration was exacerbated by the fact that it was our first day there, and we were definitely not accustomed to this inordinate level of checks. The next few days would be less of a chore, as we got (somewhat) used to it.
