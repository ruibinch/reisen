title: Alone in Almaty

After the adventures at Altyn Arashan, Isaac had been forced to cut short his trip due to a severe ankle sprain. It resulted in me being alone for the remaining 4 days of the trip. What remained was a 2-night stay in Almaty, an overnight flight back to Bangkok, 8 hours in Bangkok and finally, the flight home.

## Crossing from Kyrgyzstan to Kazakhstan

We had departed Karakol at 9am and reached back to Bishkek at about 3pm. After I parted with Isaac at the bus station, I went in search of a bus with an "Алматы" (Almaty) sign on it. The same protocol followed - the minivan would only depart once it was filled up. This time, I had to wait a little longer - about 20-30 minutes - as the minivan had been quite empty when I boarded. It was about 4pm by the time the minivan eventually set off.

*Minivan ride across the Kyrgyzstan-Kazakhstan border*

Bishkek is located very near to the Kyrgyzstan-Kazakhstan border and we reached there within half an hour. Upon nearing the border, the minivan stopped and everyone filed out of the bus, similar to the procedure when taking a bus from Singapore to Malaysia. I followed along with the crowd - I retrieved my bag from the back of the van and walked to the border post. The border post was not a large place and there were many counters, so queues for the counters were overlapping with one another, making it quite a messy scene. I settled on a queue and awaited my turn.

When it was my turn, the border guard took my passport and inspected the cover with the Singapore crest. Then, he flipped inside to examine my photo. Then, he examined my Germany visa. Then, he flipped to the back of my passport to examine my entry and exit stamps for China and Kyrgyzstan. Back to my photo. Made a photocopy of my passport photo. Back to my Germany visa. Slowly examined all my passport stamps, page by page. Back to my photo. Back to the crest on the cover. Back to the exit stamps for Kyrgyzstan. Back to my Germany visa. Made a photocopy of my Germany visa. This process repeated itself over and over and over again, where he seemingly scrutinised every inch of every stamp that was in my passport, and also made multiple copies of my passport photo and Germany visa (for God knows what reason). In the reflection of the glass window at the counter, I witnessed people behind me with an exasperated look on their faces, many of whom switched queues after a while. The entire process took a ridiculous 15-20 minutes. That might have been the first time a Singapore passport had crossed his hands, nevertheless the reaction it elicited seemed really over-the-top. Finally, I got my passport back with the Kazakhstan entry stamp and I could proceed onwards to the bag screening. Again, my passport was subjected to inspection, albeit thankfully shorter this time. All in all, I took a good half hour to clear the customs. When I finally stepped out of the building, I witnessed my minivan driver with a look on his face that clearly said "oh finally, there you are". I felt the daggers being shot in my direction as I boarded the minivan; I was clearly the burden causing everyone's timing to be delayed. Blame the Kazakh border guard!

*At a rest stop between the border and Almaty*

The ride from the border to Almaty felt arduously long - I slept and woke up multiple times to the point where the sleep was no longer refreshing. The sky was dark by the time we approached the city and it was 9pm when the bus finally deposited us at the bus station - it had been a 4-hour journey from the border. Though I was finally in Almaty, I still had a huge problem - I had to find the apartment. I tried searching for a nearby metro station on an offline maps app but it was futile; I resorted to taking an exorbitantly priced taxi instead to the place that was indicated on the map.

When I reached my destination however, the place looked nothing like a block of apartments. It was, in fact, an office building. I entered the building and asked the security guard for help, but again, the language barrier rendered the expedition useless. I walked around the area more in case the pinpointed address had been off by a few blocks, but the entire street was for commercial use; there were no residential units at all. At that time, it was approaching 10pm and the only thing I had eaten the entire day was the breakfast in the Karakol hostel in the morning and some biscuits on the minivan rides over. There was a telephone number provided in the booking, but I had no SIM card, so I was unable to make calls or even search the Internet for more information.

I continued walking around the area and came across a park. A couple who looked to be in their mid-30s were lounging on one of the benches. I approached them for assistance, with the intention of borrowing a phone from them so that I could call the number provided in the booking. I recounted my story to them. The man took out his phone and dialled the number himself; he then had a long conversation with the other party over the line in Kazakh (presumably). After he was done with the call, he briefed me on what was going on - although the booking was for a place titled "Lessor Centre Apartments", it was not actually situated in a single apartment block. Instead, they were the landlord for apartments scattered all over the city. The address that I had received during the booking was the address for their corporate office, where I had been supposed to visit and enquire on where my apartment was located exactly. Clearly, I came way too late past their closing hours.

The man informed me that he had just spoken to the manager, who mentioned that he would call back after half an hour with the address of my apartment. Presumably, he was doing the necessary preparations for a customer whom he had probably given up hope on. That meant that I would have to stick around the couple for another half hour, given that the manager would be returning the call to his phone. I queried on the availability of any food establishments nearby; by that point, I was famished and food quality was not a primary concern. They brought me to a cafe that was just a couple of minutes away. I ordered a soup and a main course, and settled down to await my belated dinner.

*I have no idea what this is actually*

As I was eating, the couple ordered a couple of drinks for themselves and we began chatting. I learnt that the guy had previously lived in various countries all over the world - he had studied and worked in Germany as well as the USA. That explains why his English was, by far, the best out of all the people I had met in the past week in the 2 -stans. He told me more about Kazakhstan, I told him more about Singapore. We remained there until his phone rang, signalling that my apartment had been found. I remember the total bill for us being around 2300 tenge \(~$9\), of which my portion was 1500 tenge \(~$6\). However, he paid the bill first and was adamant in only accepting 1000 tenge from me. I was profusely humbled and touched by his generosity.

He mentioned that my apartment was located quite nearby to where we were; it was only a few streets down. They then proceeded to accompany me all the way there. At the entrance of the apartment block stood a man leaning against a motorbike, whom I presume was the manager. There, I thanked the couple profusely for going so far out of their way just to assist me. I wished that I had some token of appreciation that I could pass to them, but unfortunately I did not have anything of that sort. I didn't even get a photo with them for keepsake.

The manager then brought me up to the apartment to show me around the place. I expressed my apologies for being so late; upon mentioning that I had travelled all the way from Karakol in the morning, he immediately understood and sympathised with me. After I finally unpacked my stuff and took a refreshing shower, I lay down on the bed in the apartment and recounted on the happenings of the day - I had spent a total of 10 hours on 2 minivans, crossed a border crossing that took much longer than expected, experienced a fleeting feeling of being homeless in a foreign city, met 2 kindred spirits who helped me more than I could imagine, to reach where I was. The pure kindness of the couple to assist me, even going so far as to treat a portion of my meal, was downright humbling and will be something that I will always remember.

## Exploring Almaty

Almaty was the financial capital of Kazakhstan; in fact, it was the country's capital until 1997, when the capital was shifted to Astana in an effort to attract more investment to the centre of the country. It was, by far, the most-developed city that I had visited outside of Ürümqi. The streets were arranged in a grid formation with green trees lining most of them. Shopping malls and tall office buildings were plentiful. There was a metro system, the first time I had taken a train in 2 weeks.

*Luscious greenery was a commonplace sight*

One morning, I stumbled across an event being held in a park, which involved various people going up to a stage to perform musical pieces as well as a variety of some carnival-like games. I duly spent a good hour plus sitting on a nearby park bench, enjoying the music and the sight of the bustling scene. Some great melodious pieces were heard, most memorably *Katyusha*, one of my favourite melodies. That I was listening to it while in an ex-Soviet country made it all the more fitting.

*No idea on the true purpose of this event*

After a couple of unexciting days, it was finally time to head home via the Almaty-Bangkok-Singapore route. Ciao to Central Asia, not sure if I'll ever be back!
