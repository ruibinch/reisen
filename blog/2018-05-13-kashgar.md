Kashgar, or Kashi, is one of the westernmost cities in the Xinjiang region and served as an important trading post back in the Silk Road days. Today, this city is significantly dominated by Uighurs and the juxtaposition of such an Islamic city situated in China is glaring. The Old Town area exudes a distinctly Central Asian/Persian vibe that conjures up memories of Turkish markets rather than Chinese heritage. Unfortunately today, this city having a Uighur-centric population means one thing - more security.

This increased security was evident the minute we stepped into our taxi from Kashgar Airport. In addition to the grille between the driver and the passenger that we had gotten used to by then, there was a camera attached to the grille staring us in our faces. The obvious differences between Kashgar and Urumqi continued to manifest itself as we strolled around the city, and especially within the Uighur-dominated old town. All the shops had a solid iron grille before the door, most of which required the owner to buzz you in. Security patrols in groups of 3 were abundant and we witnessed many instances where random citizens were stopped along the street for an ID inspection. Some parts of the old town were surrounded by police barricades, where we had to present our passports for an inspection before we could pass.

Our hostel did not help to lift the mood - it was rated a measly 6.5/10 on Hostelworld and it was evident why (though we didn't have much of a choice since there were only ~3 hostels in Kashgar that were legally allowed to take foreigners). The bright side was that we had an entire 6-bed dorm to ourselves and it came with an attached toilet. The downside was a whole host of other things, but most prominently, the quality of the toilet. The toilet bowl was of a reverse squatting variation, with the shower head situated directly above it. Hence, whenever I took a shower, my head would be directly above the toilet hole, from which an eclectic mix of smells exuded. The public toilet outside was even worse; the partitions between the cubicles were barely up to my hip, allowing anyone to gain an unobstructed view into each individual cubicle and provide words of encouragement to the current occupant.

## Kashgar Old Town

Kashgar Old Town is probably as authentic as an old town could get. As we strolled along the streets, it felt as if we had been transported back in time. Blacksmiths pounded away at the anvil, shaping the metal they were working with; butchers hung dead sheep from the ceiling hooks to slap and slice them; people lounged on chairs and played checkers-type games with one another. The air was filled with the rustic sounds of the blacksmith's hammer, the chatter of the people milling around, the sizzle of the roadside barbecue stand serving freshly barbecued meat. The atmosphere was soothing and the pace of life was slow; it seemed like a tranquil oasis amid the hectic bustle of the world.

The entire day, we strolled around the area in a way befitting of our environment - calm, languid, relaxed. We stopped by a 100-year-old teahouse, which seemingly had a 90-10 demographic proportion of Uighurs to non-Uighurs. Old Uighur men with long white beards sat around tables, drinking tea and chatting with one another. Now and then, some people would start a song and they would all sing and dance along in good spirits. It seemed like that was a common meeting point where everyone knew everyone; new arrivals were greeted joyfully by the people present and they slotted in seamlessly into the flow of things. We sat firmly in the corner, outside of this bubble, and wondered where on earth were we in the world.

There was a fair share of eating places around the old town, however it seemed like regardless of the shop we walked into, the menu was roughly similar. There was little variety in the Uighur food; it was worth a try for a couple of meals but nothing beyond that. They not only shared the same menu but also shared the same spices, so everything literally tasted the same. Then again, how often would I get to eat authentic Uighur food?

*The same menu repeated everywhere*

At night, as we were on our way back to our hostel, we decided to stop by a convenience store to get some snacks in preparation for our day trip out to Karakul Lake the next day. Just one problem - everything was expired. The first store we patronised, we thought it was an anomaly. The second one we visited, the doubt increased. After going to the third, fourth and fifth stores, we realised that it was the norm - everything was literally expired. Regardless of whether it was biscuits or nuts or sauces, the expiry dates were all the same, that it was before May 2018. Dec 2017, Sep 2017, April 2017, even August 2016. In addition, most of the items were covered with a healthy (or unhealthy) layer of dust. Eventually, I decided that my pack of cashew nuts, bought in Singapore and unexpired, would be sufficient and preferable compared to taking a chance on the expired foodstuff.

## Karakul Lake (喀拉库勒湖)

The travelling distance from the city of Kashgar to Karakul Lake, by road, was about 200km. However, the estimated journey time was 4-4.5 hours one-way, due to an asinine speed limit of 50km/h. This applied to large portions of the highway, even the stretches where the road was a straight line stretching out to the horizon. The highway, or at least the parts nearer to the city, was also littered with a multitude of speed cameras. The 2 of us shared a van with a Chinese couple from Suzhou, along with our driver. Our driver assured us that the cameras were constantly monitored and any vehicle found breaking the speed limit would be severely dealt with. Given that we were in Xinjiang, we took his word.

The highway that we were traversing was the northern portion of the famed Karakoram Highway, one of the highest roads in the world, with its maximum point at 4,714m near Khunjerab Pass, the mountainous border crossing between China and Pakistan. The entire highway stretches from Kashgar in Xinjiang all the way down to Abbottabad in Pakistan, a good length of 1,300km running through one of the highest mountain ranges in the world. We merely traversed 200km out of its entire length.

Our first stop was a street-side stand that sold 羊肉抓饭 (fried rice with lamb) and some naan-looking thing. Just that it was a little bit bigger than the naan that we were used to; in fact, it was bigger than my entire face. It looked more like a large Frisbee or dinner plate instead of an edible. However, the looks of it were deceiving - we managed to subsist on that all the way till the next day, where we ventured on our border crossing expedition (that's for another chapter).

*Dinner plate or naan?*

As Kashgar is situated at ~1300m altitude and Karakul Lake is at ~3650m, there was a significant amount of altitude to climb. We were driving up the mountains, when our driver stopped for a break at a toilet in the mountains. The phrase "toilet in the mountains" should be self-explanatory to answer the question "What was the toilet condition?" The toilet simply comprised of a number of holes with a <1m wall separating each "cubicle", where the holes opened up to a common landing pit 5 metres below. Around each hole was an abundance of dried crusted faeces, representing the remaining deposits from people whose accuracy was a little lacking. As I peered down a hole, I witnessed a colourful amalgamation of piss, dung and an assortment of other stuff in one gigantic pile, with flies buzzing all around. I added my own contribution and watched it fall gracefully down 5m to add to the multifarious mash-up below me. I shuddered to think of the scenario where one accidentally fell down one of the holes.

It was a relief to finally reach Karakul Lake after 4.5 hours of being on the road. Upon getting out of the car, we were welcomed with a great howling wind that almost buffeted us off our feet. Due to the altitude, we had been pre-warned by our driver on the dangers of exerting too much energy, i.e. we should only stroll around at a normal pace and not run and jump around. And so, we strolled leisurely around the area, admiring the view that lay infront of us. Unfortunately, the sky that day was pretty cloudy, making it impossible to get that picture-perfect shot of the scene. Nevertheless, it was still a sight to behold - the lake stretched out infront, with a row of snow-capped mountains framed in the background, most prominently being the 7,546m Muztagh Ata. Now and then, ice crystals would be blown into our faces by the wind all the way from the mountains on the other side of the lake. I noted that this was my new personal record on altitude - 3,650m up in the Tibetan Plateau, what a place, what a moment.

The return ride was terribly dreary, crawling back down the same highway at a snail's pace and forced to pass through the same security checks once more. As we were nearing the city, our driver turned into a petrol station to refill the tank. But, before he could turn in, he had to first stop and request for us to disembark as only the driver was permitted to enter. The Xinjiang definition of a petrol station was starkly different - it was surrounded by a high barbed wire fence, with a vehicle barricade at the entrance and a policeman conducting a thorough inspection of every vehicle before it was permitted entry. It was more representative of an army camp instead of a simple petrol station. We milled around outside, waiting for our driver to finish and drive out before we could rejoin the vehicle.

Throughout the entire day, we had been making small bits of conversation with the Chinese couple in their mid-40s that we were sharing the car with. Nearing the end, the woman inquired for my Wechat, which I gave. The hilarious thing is that 1+ week after the event, she sent me 5 photos that she had surreptitiously taken of us. They were really nice candid photos too, such as the one featured in the header of this post.

## Late-night hostel drama

After our exhausting day trip out to Karakul Lake, we headed back to the hostel, weary and tired, to spend our last night there before bidding farewell to China. We were eager to wash up and rest as soon as possible, given that we would be spending the entirety of the following day on the road again. Unfortunately, it was not meant to be. When we reached back to the hostel at 11+pm, we found the entire place to be pitch-black. Initially, we thought that the power had tripped. However, the hostel owner came forward and informed us of the real reason.

Besides us, there had been 3 other American foreigners staying at the hostel that day. During the day, they had apparently been caught doing some unlawful stuff in the old town. The police had managed to track them all the way to the hostel, where they had been confronted and then subsequently taken away for further questioning. The police had also enquired on our whereabouts, however the hostel owner had been unable to give a reply as we had not informed her of our intentions. Then, as a punishment of sorts, the police had cut the power to the hostel and revoked their license to be able to host foreigners for a month. This meant that we were, by right, barred from spending the night there as well. However, the owner reassured us that the police would not conduct an inspection at night and we could still spend the night there, but it would be preferable if we left early the next day to prevent a complicated scene if the police did indeed return.

As she recounted the story, the prevailing sentiment in my mind was simply "What the heck?". It was a lot to digest, especially after a long day of travelling, and that we had been looking forward to a quick shower and rest. Her words that there would be no police inspection at night were not too reassuring given that we were in Xinjiang after all and any disruption of this kind would be severely detrimental. Spending another day being interrogated by policemen in Xinjiang was definitely less appealing than continuing on to Kyrgyzstan for the next leg of our trip. Nevertheless, that was the best option we had. We hurriedly took a shower (once the power finally returned after half an hour) and rested, hoping that we would not be turned out at night. Army flashbacks indeed.

The next morning, we woke up early and hurriedly left the hostel by 8am. I was glad to be out of that place as soon as possible.
