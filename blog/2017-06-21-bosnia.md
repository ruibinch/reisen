At the time of writing of this piece (April 2018), it had been almost a year since my exchange adventures took place. As I recall my travel experiences, Bosnia & Herzegovina remains one of my favourite places that I had travelled to, filled with both fond and poignant memories. In all my Europe expeditions, the friendliest and most hospitable people I had met were all during my Bosnian trip, from our Airbnb host to coffee shop owners to our travel guides. At the same time, all these positive experiences were interspersed with the tragic history of the capital city. Numerous buildings remained dotted with bullet holes and shrapnel fragments, despite the terrible Bosnian War ending more than 20 years ago. I had been stunned and amazed when I first saw these ugly reminders of the war; by the end of the first day, it had lost its hue as it was so commonplace.

## The setting

### BiH as a country

Bosnia is one of the poorest countries in Europe and plagued with the typical problems associated with other Eastern European countries - rampant corruption, a stagnant economy and a brain drain of the country's youth out towards Western Europe. The average income is less than 500€/month and the youth unemployment rate is over 50%. We learnt that it is not too uncommon a sight to see a group of youths go to the same café to hang out and spend the entire day there, day after day after day, as there are literally no jobs available for them. A large majority of the youth, if within their means, would look to move out to Western European countries in search of better job opportunities and a better life. This creates a vicious cycle where young people move out due to the lack of promising prospects, which reduces the incentive for companies to invest in the country and create jobs, and the downward cycle repeats.

A common event that I heard being mentioned frequently by the locals was the 1984 Winter Olympics. It had been hosted by Sarajevo back then, to great success, and still remains as a source of pride and a point of reference to which people use to refer to as "the better times". It is a depressingly damning sign that people have to go all the way back to over 3 decades ago to find something that is a significant positive for them. Since then, the only significant event (although definitely not a positive) that had happened was the war itself, which was then followed by 20 years of being in limbo, partly due to the flawed Dayton Agreement but largely due to a totally inept government.

I had previously mentioned on the geography of the city, that it was surrounded by hills on all sides. During the 1980s, there had been a cable car system connecting the city up to the hills, which was also where the Winter Olympics had taken place. This cable car was destroyed during the war and, until now, it still remains as a distant memory. The locals mentioned that all the equipment for reconstruction was actually ready – the cables, the pulley systems, etc. – but the government somehow could not kickstart the project itself, citing the excuse of insufficient funds. Perhaps because it was all going to paying off the maintenance fees for their mansions. Never had I realised so strongly on the critical importance of a good government; a bad government can easily cripple a country for decades to come. Is it possible for the government to be overthrown, I asked. The locals responded, given that they control the media and practically everything, it is an extremely tall task.

### Sarajevo

Sarajevo, save for a couple of newer skyscrapers, looks like a city that is stuck in the 1990s. The city is served by one rickety tram system and trams that look like they have been in use for 20 years. Due to their tiny size, they are usually overcrowded and our Airbnb host kindly discouraged us from using it due to the prevalence of pickpockets on board.

When we went to purchase our train tickets to travel to Mostar, the counter attendant took out a booklet and manually wrote down our tickets, including our assigned seats. He then checked off our assigned seats on the legend that he had beside him. It was an eye-opening process and I kept the manually written tickets as a memorable keepsake.

The upside of this relative un-modernisation is that the old town is, literally, an old town. It is filled with predominantly one- or two-storey buildings; amongst which spans a mazy network of tiny streets lined with an assortment of shops on both sides. Most of the area is pedestrian-only as it is impossible for a car to fit in the narrow alleyways. Hence, it conveys a genuine rustic vibe and a real village spirit, where everyone knows one another due to the close proximity. This sense of familiarity was evident everywhere we walked, where shopkeepers would wave a greeting towards locals passing by on the streets and people would stop to have a chat as they bumped into one another. Also, the place was not inundated with an overflow of tourists which dampens the charm of the place (I recognise the hypocrisy here). Thus, despite the abundance of old towns across many European cities, it was quite unlike any other old town that I had been to and it certainly offered the most genuine experience.

## Hospitality of the locals

Everywhere we went in Sarajevo, we encountered welcoming people, kind gestures and warm smiles. There was our affable walking tour guide, who led us on a tour around the city and pointed out all the notable sites during the war. There was a coffee shop owner in Sarajevo, who welcomed us warmly into his café and chatted happily with us in a mix of German and broken English. There were several amicable waiters, who joked with us and inquired on where we came from. It was extremely heartwarming to continuously receive these random acts of kindness from all kinds of people.

One of my fondest memories of the entire trip, and my entire exchange experience, occurred during a day trip to Mostar. We had set off to the city with not much of a plan, save for a visit to a coffee shop with sparkling online reviews. It was time to try the famed Bosnian coffee!

The shop owner was a young man in his late-20s, who had set up the entire shop himself. After he made our coffee, he brought it over in a tray – it was served in a _džezva_, accompanied with a small cup to drink from, a cup of water and some sugar cubes. He then duly spent a good 3 minutes giving a short history lesson on the coffee as well as educating us on the correct way to drink it – take a sip of water before drinking the coffee, don't stir the coffee, don't insert the sugar cube into the drink but instead place it under your tongue for it to dissolve as you sip. We learnt that it was both a national symbol and a favourite pastime, as, in his words, "the most important thing about Bosnian coffee is time" – this applied to everything regarding the coffee, from the time to cook it to the amount of time spent drinking it. It should not be something to be downed in one gulp (and also not advised, given its strength), but instead, to be slowly sipped, preferably over a couple of hours and good conversation.

And so, we followed it to the letter – we spent 1.5 hours in the morning sitting on the sofa, drinking our coffee at a sedentary pace and chatting with the owner. In fact, after we left for lunch and explored the city, we returned and spent another 2 hours there in the afternoon, with a new serving of Bosnian coffee and more engaging conversation. When we finally had to leave to catch our return bus to Sarajevo, I bought a bag of Bosnian coffee powder from him and he threw in a complimentary *džezva* as well! This is the perfect example of why I would never follow a tour – this experience would never have been possible when following a tour group, where spontaneous and unplanned moments are eschewed in favour of a fixed schedule and a checklist of places to visit.

## Effects of the war

As highlighted previously, the theme of the war still lingers over the entire city despite the 20+ years that has since passed. It manifests itself in various forms – there are an abundance of companies offering war tours around the city, bringing tourists to the notable sites of the war; several memorials and museums dedicated to the war; and most obviously, the countless bullet holes and shrapnel craters that pepper the city infrastructure. It is somewhat of a pity that the war, in a way, overshadows the city itself. It is a unique draw which will spark the interest of tourists, but it is not too pleasant if that is the main selling point of the city.

Of course, I was one of the tourists who got sucked into travelling to Bosnia for this reason, and I made the most of my time there by visiting numerous tours and museums related to the wartime. The first war tour we went for was a simple walking tour, where the guide brought us to notable places around the city. Some shrapnel craters had been painted over in red and were termed as "blood roses". Then, there was one of the more unique memorials, which was simply a giant can of canned beef. It was more of a sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek monument to the war. When the city had been under siege, there was a shortage of food supplies, and international organisations and other countries would chip in to contribute some food to the people. However, most of the food they gave was either wholly impractical or expired for years (the locals recounted stories of how even dogs would not be willing to eat the food). The canned beef represented a microcosm of the entire situation – it was completely inappropriate due to the lack of can-openers, it was expired most of the time and it tasted terrible.

Another tour brought us to the tunnel that had served as the lifeline between Sarajevo and the outside world during the days of the siege. It was situated under the airport and represented the only way that food and other supplies could make its way into the besieged city. It was a 1.5m-high, tiny, narrow tunnel and I was left incredulous as to how they managed to utilise that as a supply channel for more than 3 years. We then went to a graveyard on the hills overlooking the city; we learnt that the graveyard was favoured for use as a shooting range by the Bosnian Serb forces due to the vantage point of the graveyard and the secondary function of the gravestones as a bullet shield. As expected, the gravestones themselves were also riddled with bullet holes.

Emina, our guide for this tour, shared a few of her harrowing personal stories of the war. At that time, she was a 10-year-old girl but was the main "breadwinner" of the family in terms of procuring food and goods. Everyday, she trekked out to search for these items amidst the gunfire and shelling that rained down from the hills. She mentioned that she was now decently fluent in Arabic, due to her frequent interactions with the Egyptian forces who were stationed in Sarajevo during the war. I was in total awe at her mental fortitude and what she must have endured as a little girl providing for her family in such times.

Despite all that she, and the entire country, had gone through, they were still not faring too well in current times. It was with a tinge of bitterness that she bemoaned her possession of a Bosnian passport rather than a Croatian passport (which she had been eligible for) that would have granted access to the EU and thus offered much better prospects relative to Bosnia. Due to the extremely complicated and flawed tripartite presidency of the country of Bosnia, it is virtually unlikely that they would be able to gain EU membership in the foreseeable future.

One of the main monuments dedicated to the Bosnian War is "Gallery 11/07/95". The date commemorates the Srebrenica massacre, where 8,000 Muslim Bosniaks were killed in an appalling and blatant act of genocide. Upon entering the museum, the first thing I saw was an entire wall of human portraits of people who had perished there. Just beside the wall was a book filled with names of the deceased. It was especially heartbreaking to witness a series of names with all the same surnames – an entire lineage wiped out in a day. The other parts of the museum were largely decorated with portraits of wartime, from pictures of corpses to writings on the wall.

There was a short film being played that evoked an immense feeling of anguish in me, which I can remember vividly till today. It was titled ["10 Minutes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9qm-Vbhglc), which contrasted the time duration of 10 minutes in Rome in the year 1995, where a tourist was waiting for his photos to be developed, to 10 minutes in Sarajevo, where a young boy had left his house to obtain some rations, but discovered upon his return that his entire family had just been killed by an airstrike. I watched it once, then a second time, and then a third time; it was gripping, agonising, heartbreaking.
