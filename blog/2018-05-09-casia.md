Unknown. Dangerous. No point in travelling there. Those are, typically and stereotypically, the average sentiment of a random Joe regarding their attitude towards Central Asia. It is one of the areas of the world that constantly flies under the radar, and is most definitely not a common travel destination for Singaporeans. For all the freedom provided by the Singapore passport, which almost perpetually ranks among the top 3 passports in terms of travel freedom, it remains criminally underutilised by the locals. Countries off the beaten track, like those in Central Asia, are often eschewed for comfort travel destinations in Korea/Japan, Australia, Europe and USA.

This happens for a variety of reasons, but one of the most common is likely the aversion to travelling into the unknown. There is nothing wrong with such a mindset; however, it is indeed quite a waste, as there are countless hidden gems out there in the world that remain untouched by tourism despite their massive potential. If one does take the step to venture out into these uncharted and exotic lands, it is likely that they will be rewarded with an immensely satisfying and memorable experience, arguably more so than being one of the tens of millions of tourists that descend on a typical tourist destination every year.

And that is the experience that we enjoyed following our trip to Central Asia. Memorable unique experiences of this trip include navigating the omnipresent language barrier in Kyrgyzstan - even most young people do not speak English, which thus necessitated the use of a variety of hand signals and the frequent usage of the phone calculator when negotiating prices - as well as being greeted by stares, head turns and inquiring questions everywhere. And, of course, meeting the locals. Most of the locals that we met were all amazingly warm and bursting with genuine friendliness, willing to go out of the way to help us without a moment's hesitation. There were a few especially memorable people that we met; those experiences will be documented for nostalgia's sake in the future. All these stories, wrapped up into a package, form an indelible memory in my mind, and will always elicit a smile on my face whenever I recount my Central Asia trip of May 2018.
