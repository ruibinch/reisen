It is impossible to talk about Bosnia without mentioning the Bosnian War, which occurred from 1992 to 1995, and it is likewise impossible to understand the war without some basic understanding about it. Having watched my fair share of documentaries regarding this war, both before and after my visit, I will outline a brief overview of the war, and by extension, the breakup of Yugoslavia.

Previously, Yugoslavia was an entity comprised of several individual states – Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro (and Kosovo for some, although this is an issue for another day). Until 1980, it was functioning well with a solid economy, with nationalistic tendencies among the individual states being quickly snuffed out.

Then, in 1980, the leader of Yugoslavia, Josip Tito, passed away. As there was no strong leader on an equivalent footing to him who could continue to uphold his principles, the following decade saw the rise of nationalism and the gradual warring between the different factions. Eventually, in 1991, the breakup of Yugoslavia began. Slovenia seceded from Yugoslavia with little bloodshed and Croatia followed suit thereafter, with slightly more bloodshed but nothing compared to what was about to come.

Bosnia was the next state which wished to declare independence, however they faced great opposition from Serbia. The demographics of Bosnia complicated things severely; it was comprised of 3 vastly different ethnic groups - Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats. The truncated version of the story is that Bosnian Muslims and Croats were proponents of independence, however the Bosnian Serbs were against it as many of them remained loyal to Serbia and by extension Yugoslavia, as Belgrade was its capital. An independence referendum conducted in Bosnia had passed, however this had been boycotted by a large majority of the Bosnian Serbs. They rejected the decision, and, backed by the large Serbian force, began an action to seize the Bosnian land which purportedly belonged to the Serbs.

The geography of Sarajevo and the surrounding area were to its severe detriment during the war – the city was surrounded by mountains on virtually all sides, representing a perfect place for the Bosnian Serb forces to set up and obtain an unobstructed vantage point of the city, from which they could unleash a hail of terror. This siege lasted for a total of 44 months, the longest siege of a capital city in human history. The only point of entry and exit to the capital was a tunnel under the airport; meanwhile, the citizens went about their daily lives every day with a roulette chance of being blown up by a shell or shot down by a bullet from the hills.

I could go on, but I think this provides sufficient insight into the war for understanding purposes. It is mind-boggling that over 20 years have passed since and yet much of the city remains in relative disrepair. It amazes me how friendly and hospitable the people are despite the bleak situation that they were, and are in, unfortunately for differing reasons.
