From Osh, we travelled up to Bishkek, the capital, via a 1-hour flight. One semi-notable event of the journey was the departure from Osh Airport. After clearing the boarding checks at the terminal, we were instructed to board a bus which would fetch us to the airplane, a normal occurrence for such smaller airports. The not-so-normal occurrence was the ridiculously short bus journey - it travelled for less than 30 seconds, and stopped. I looked back and saw that we had only travelled about 100m. In fact, after boarding the plane, I could still receive the Wi-Fi signal from the terminal.

Our hostel was called "Bishkek Homestel" and it indeed did feel like a home instead of a hostel. People ambled around at their own pace and acknowledged us as we walked by. There was a cozy corner in the yard where people could gather around and chat. The staff didn't feel like staff as well; in fact, I was initially quite confused on who were actually the staff and who were the tourists. Our terrible hostel in Kashgar was slowly becoming a distant memory.

## Exploring Bishkek with a 57y/o Swedish guy

As we were leaving the hostel for lunch, a fellow resident came up to us and enquired if he could join us, to which we agreed to. The best word to describe how he looked was simply - eccentric. He was not a young guy (later, we learnt that he was at a grand age of 57 years old) and looked distinctly European (later, we learnt that he came from Sweden). He had a long ponytail, but it somehow looked more like the stiff bristles of a broom rather than being comprised of hair. His appearance was unkempt, his clothes and shoes looked haggard and worn.

*The picture says it all*

As we conversed with him over lunch, we learnt more of his life story and indeed, it fit right in with his appearance. He was an adopter of the free, nomadic lifestyle - he recounted that he would work at home for a few months till he had enough money and then traipse off to some part of the world, where he would remain till the money supply ran dry. Then, the process would rinse and repeat. He rambled on about a woman whom he used to embark on his travels with, until she said (quoted directly from him), "Peter, I can't keep up with your lifestyle anymore". That apparently happened 7 years ago, and he reminisced about the good times that they had together in various parts of the world. His appearance, personality and manner of speech were all intriguing, to say the least.

After our lunch, we proceeded on to a casual walking tour of the city. Our lunch buddy mentioned that he had nothing to do, so he followed along with us as well. So there we were, a merry band of 3, 2 distinctly Asian-looking people walking around with 1 distinctly European guy with a broom-styled ponytail who looked old enough to be our fathers. To say that we attracted stares was an understatement. As we walked down the main street that was lined with shops and people, I felt like a celebrity - everywhere, people were staring at us and/or looking at us and whispering to their friends. I can't blame them; after all, in a place where there are few tourists to begin with, it's not everyday that you get to witness the sight of a motley group like ours casually strolling down the street.

It was not a bad experience though, it was quite a memorable day after all thanks to his continuous eccentric antics. He harboured a particular fascination with the idea of purchasing/renting a horse with a guide and going around exploring various areas of the country on horseback, before giving the horse as a present to the guide at the end. So much so that he would pop this enquiry to random strangers along the street, those whom he prospected as potentially having some knowledge in this domain - "would you know where I might be able to get a horse and a guide to explore the country with?", complete with mimicking of the horse actions. He was completely unfazed by the attention that we were attracting; on the contrary, he revelled in it - he would happily wave to people who were staring at us and strike up conversations with arbitrary people along the street. Then again, he was probably used to it given that the sight of him alone would be sufficient to elicit such a reaction from the general public in any country around the globe. He was a fascinating character to study.

## Stories at the homestel

Above, I mentioned of the cozy corner in the yard of our homestel. At night, we headed over there and listened to a wide array of fantastic stories.

![casia/bishkek/DSC_0316.JPG](/img/casia/bishkek/DSC_0316.JPG)
*The cozy corner of the yard*

Most of us were tourists, so one common factor was the discussion on how and where we were travelling to next - it was possible for this to become a fervent discussion solely because we were in the remote lands of Central Asia where public transport is minimal and the geographical challenges are massive. We managed to learn that our preferred method of entering Kazakhstan - via the Kegen pass - was largely unfeasible, due to the exorbitant price of transport there. A fellow Singaporean guy (what are the odds), who had spent the last 11 days in a farm in the countryside, talked about the importance of clan hierarchy in the Kyrgyz society, something that he had learnt during his farm stay. In Kyrgyzstan, almost everyone was part of a clan, a concept that began centuries ago but still persists today. The clan structure and hierarchy was practically regarded as law - clan loyalty was of utmost importance and one had to comply with anything the clan leader dictates. If the leader suddenly proclaims that 2+2 is actually 5, the members were expected to adhere to it blindly and adopt it as the truth as well. Additional personal research led me to [this article](http://countrystudies.us/kyrgyzstan/11.htm), which provides a great detailed expectation.

The memorable story of the night came from a Spanish guy who was working for an NGO in Bishkek for a year. When we asked if he had been staying in the homestel all along from the start, he recounted a glorious story. Previously, he had been staying in an apartment with a family in the city. For some reason, the mum and dad of the family practically enforced a curfew on him, directing him to be back by 10pm everyday. Given that he was an avid party-goer, that was not an ideal situation. The nail in the coffin came soon after that. The dad had participated in a competition and won a prize - a sheep, which was apparently a great gift to receive. The dad brought the sheep back to the house and culled it. So, when Spanish guy came back home at night, he was greeted with the delightful smell of sheep blood hanging around in the house. Upon going to the bathroom to take a shower, the sheep's head was staring back at him in the bathtub, surrounded by intestines and its own blood. He left the next morning.

## Ala Archa National Park

Ala Archa National Park is an alpine park located about 40km south of Bishkek, a place we were looking to embark on a hiking expedition. To escape the hassle of figuring out how to get there via the not-so-reliable public transport system, we took up our homestel's offer of a round-trip to the park and back for a fixed price. The staff informed us that he would wait at the carpark while we went for our hike.

It was the middle of May and we had expected it to be a warm spring day where the weather was cooling and the sunshine was bright. The moment we stepped out of the van, all our expectations went up into smoke. The temperature there was already about 14Â°C (albeit at 2100m altitude) and we hadn't even begun our hike up yet.

*Our target was the waterfall*

![casia/bishkek/20180518_101405.jpg](/img/casia/bishkek/20180518_101405.jpg)
*The start of our hike; we chose the left path which was the harder route, naturally*

At the start of our hike, we were brimming with motivation. We set forth at a brisk pace, easily overtaking the 2 Swedish girls who were in front of us (as seen in the above picture). We sauntered on enthusiastically, climbing up the steep path and scaling the rocks with ease.

Within 15 minutes, we were gassed. The path was ridiculously steep; my thighs burned with every rock that I had to clamber on top of. We had clearly underestimated the difficulty of the trail and obscenely overestimated our level of fitness. We tried to press on but every couple of minutes, we had to stop for a breather. My thighs became wobbly, my panting became more and more pronounced, I was in a full sweat despite the cool weather. Soon, the 2 Swedish girls passed by us with a smile (or was it a smirk?) and left us in their wake.

Thankfully, the path levelled off after the initial torturous, lung-bursting, exhausting 30-40 minutes. We were now on a mountain overlooking the valley, which contained a meandering river that was devoid of water as the ice caps on the mountains were not yet melted. More mountains loomed in front of us. In fact, our 360-degree view was completely filled with mountains. It was a breathtaking sight.

*The valley and the mountains*

As we continued our trek, the views continued to astound. It was literally impossible to take a bad photo there. Can't go wrong with mountains, valleys, fir trees and aesthetic-looking stones.

*Navigating a field of rocks*

After some time, we reached the waterfall, or what would have been the waterfall had the ice caps on the mountain already melted. We came across the 2 Swedish girls again, who were taking a snack break at a clearing of sorts. We duly joined them for our own snack break as well.

*Rest point overlooking the waterfall*

As we were eating our biscuits and bananas, all of a sudden, snow came falling down. We looked up in astonishment; we were half-freezing by then, but we definitely had not expected that it was thaaat cold to result in snowfall. I was wearing a long sleeve shirt and a light jacket plus jeans, hardly attire fitting for an occasion of snow.

The Swedish girls finished their meals and headed back to the starting point, citing the snow as a deal-breaker in continuing with the hike. We debated on whether to follow their footsteps or to be gung-ho and press on amidst the snowy conditions. Naturally, we were *garang* people. We decided to continue to go up until a point where it became completely unfeasible to continue.

The path became steep and rocky again; the higher we climbed, the heavier the snowfall. Within 20 minutes, we reached the point whereby we could not progress any further - the path ahead was rocky and covered with lots of ice, and our shoes were definitely not suitable for trekking on icy conditions. We turned back and admired the breathtaking view of the valley from the top. This time round, the view was a bit more obscured - the snowfall was heavy and a layer of mist was hanging above the area.

![casia/bishkek/DSC_0493.JPG](/img/casia/bishkek/DSC_0493.JPG)
*Looking back down at the route we just climbed up*

We slowly navigated our way back down. As we were nearing the starting point of our trek, I witnessed a group of people milling around a setup of tables with an array of foodstuff on them in the distance. It seemed to be an event of sorts. With my curiosity piqued, I suggested to head over there to check it out.

As we neared, the group of people saw us and immediately began motioning us to come over. They were a bunch of middle-aged Kyrgyz locals and they seemed to be indeed preparing for an event, given that some of them had event passes (or so I thought) around their necks. They were standing around chatting and casually drinking vodka, neat.

The moment we walked over to their table, they instantly took the bottle of vodka, poured out a generous amount into a couple of plastic cups and shoved them into our hands. Then, they took the bread lying on the table and likewise shoved them into our hands. We tried to start a conversation, but it was impossible - they did not know English. Nevertheless, their actions spoke loud and clear. They pointed at the bread and then to the sauces that were available; we duly complied to add the condiments to our bread. Before we knew it, we were doing a toast with them with our plastic cups of vodka - they did at least understand the word "drink". The amount of vodka that they drank with every toast was mind-boggling; I took a sip and immediately felt the burn in my throat and chest area. It was strong stuff! The instant the vodka level in my cup fell below 25%, someone took my cup and refilled it to a respectable amount, i.e. half full.

*Bread and vodka in the middle of the Kyrgyz mountains*

After ingesting a copious amount of vodka and a considerable amount of bread, we gestured that it was time for us to continue on our way. One of the women strode to another table, grabbed a bottle of vodka and began posturing for us to take it. We mimed no, no, it's okay, but she was a resolute woman who was not taking no for an answer. When Isaac was distracted and conversing with someone else, she opened his bag from the back and began stuffing the bottle of vodka into his bag. Fortunately, I captured that moment on video by accident; it was a priceless sight.

*Kyrgyz man with our gift*

So, somehow, we went for a hike in the mountains and ended up with a bottle of local Kyrgyz vodka. I wrapped it up securely and purchased check-in luggage for the flight back just so that it could be transported back to Singapore. It was, indeed, a priceless memento that served as a perfect encapsulation of our wild and unpredictable adventures in Kyrgyzstan.
