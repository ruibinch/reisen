420km. 14 hours. 6 vehicles. 1 border crossing. A memorable journey, to say the least. Crossing from Kashgar (China) to Osh (Kyrgyzstan) was only about 400km by road, but that figure belies the actual situation on the ground - that the Irkeshtam border pass was situated at 3000m altitude, the scarily winding mountain roads, the intense scrutiny of the Chinese customs, the ridiculous number of vehicles that we had to take, etc. It was, without a doubt, the toughest border crossing that I have done in  my life, and most likely, ever.

<!--truncate-->

Our prior research had mentally prepared us for the fact that it would take the better part of a day for us to make it to our destination (if at all). The important information that we had jotted down included:

- Chinese immigration is situated at Wuqia, 130km from the actual border (which didn't make any sense at all initially)
- Kashgar-Wuqia was operated by a bus route from 喀什汽车客运站 (Kashgar bus station)
- Border opening hours: China 1000-1300, 1630-1945; Kyrgyzstan 0900-1100, 1400-1800 - this was the most important timing, that we had to clear the China immigration before it went for its mind-bogglingly long 3.5-hour lunch break

Basically, if we didn't make it past the China immigration before the lunch break, we would have to wait till 4:30pm, at which point we would be unable to make it to Osh (as it is a 4-5hr journey from the border to Osh). In that scenario, we would have to adopt the alternative of spending a night in Sary-Tash, a town in between the border and Osh. Initially, we did not book our hostel in Osh as preparation for the worst-case scenario; but ultimately, we decided to have some faith in ourselves that we would indeed be able to accomplish our mission.

## Setting off

We woke up, bright and early, and quickly left the hostel in the morning (partially due to the events of the previous night). Our breakfast was simply whatever that we could manage to scrounge up in our bags; we were forecasting that we would be subsisting on biscuits and cookies the entire day. **Time upon leaving hostel - 8:15am.**

*Farewell to Kashgar*

We took a cab to the Kashgar bus station, feeling confident that we were nice and early, and...... it was not open yet. ... We idled outside for perhaps 20 minutes before it finally opened and we were permitted admittance. After going through our favourite security scanners, of course. We sauntered into the terminal, and...... the booths were not open yet. ... So, the bus terminal was crowded with people, but the entire place was still dark with not a single counter staff in sight, save for a security guard who was happily eating his breakfast and remarked to "simply wait till the booths are open". It was an appalling mismanagement of operations. After an hour of waiting for the materialisation of a counter staff and waiting in the queue itself, we finally got our tickets. As usual, the minivan operated on a system of "only set off once it's full"; thankfully, we did not have to wait long. **Time upon leaving bus station - 9:45am.**

## Crossing the China customs

After a ~100km journey, we reached Wuqia bus station at 11:35am. The staff informed us that the border post was another 3km away, which we seriously considered traversing via foot, but we ultimately came to our senses and flagged a cab instead. Upon reaching the police checkpoint, it was time for the famed Xinjiang security check. We entered a dark room, where we were instructed to hand over our phones. I witnessed the officer fiddling around with my phone until he managed to locate the WiFi settings - I saw him connect to a WiFi network, open my web browser and run a scan on my phone. Meanwhile, another officer was recording seemingly every single detail of me that could be recorded - date of birth, passport number, phone model number, phone IMEI number etc. It was indeed quite bizarre. Thankfully, no contraband was found and we were sent on our way.

After the police checkpoint, there was a gate, beyond which there was one single road leading on. Once we passed the gate, there was nothing around us - no vehicles, no people, i.e. we had no alternative but to traverse this part by foot. After a short walk, we saw the actual customs building looming in the distance ahead - it was **12:35pm** when we reached there, thankfully before their lunch break! We were welcomed, once again, by a security check, except that this check was the most outlandish of all. We were requested to surrender our passports and phones, which were taken away for 20 minutes while we sat around and waited with the clearly-terribly-bored police officers. Somehow, a guy appeared out of thin air, approached us and offered a ride to the border, a 1.5-hour ride which would cost us 400RMB (the 400RMB was a constant charge for the service regardless of the number of people, however we were not inclined to wait around for other tourists just to save some money as time was of the essence instead). Naturally, we agreed, since what the hell was the alternative?

At long last, our passports and phones returned from being held hostage; I opened up the "recent apps" section and saw that they had been having a field time looking through my camera pictures. Likewise for Isaac's camera, which had been scrolled till waaaaay down. And they had ran another scan on my phone again. By the time we finally set off from the customs, it was **1:20pm** - it had taken us 40 minutes to get through a completely empty immigration checkpoint. But, regardless, we had a stamp in our passport, and we were heading for the border! We were in good time, we thought.

The 130km journey from the customs to the border was full of dramatic landscape - snow mountains, red mountains, massive rock formations etc. It was literally a road that cut through the mountains, with barely a soul in sight. Maybe that's why the customs checkpoint itself was located so ridiculously far from the border, so that the poor staff wouldn't have to subject themselves to an arduous 130km journey to/from work everyday.

*Going from the customs building to the border*

After ~2 hours, we came to a stop, where we found ourselves in a queue stretching several vehicles long. We guessed that the Kyrgyz customs were on their lunch break, and we simply had to wait. At that point, we were at 3000m altitude, and the effects could definitely be felt. There were a row of shops nearby; we ducked into one of them, which turned out to be a fantastic meal of 羊肉抓饭 and some good old hot tea - it was an absolutely amazing feeling to be able to eat some proper warm food after hours of travelling and subsisting on dried biscuits and cookies. **(Time: 4.20pm)**

## Crossing the Kyrgyz customs

Soon after, the line of vehicles started moving. However, shortly after, the vehicle came to a halt again. The driver informed us that his vehicle could not cross the actual physical border and he directed us to *tompang* the van infront of us. We were thoroughly perplexed. Regardless, we followed his instructions (our driver had already passed our passports to the driver of the other van so we didn't have a choice anyway) and joined some Russian-looking people in the back of the van while saying awkward hellos. Our new ride crossed the physical border, went forward a bit and then stopped again. Now, we were on Kyrgyz territory, but the customs was another distance away and the driver was apparently not permitted to go that far, so we had to take another vehicle again. Goodness. So, the 2 of us bundled into yet another vehicle, along with a motley group of an Italian guy, an American girl, an Australian guy and a New Zealand guy. The driver drove for perhaps 5 minutes and then collected 100RMB total from us. Dammit, we could have simply walked that short distance!

Regardless, we were now at the Kyrgyz customs **(Time: 5:10pm)**. By then, practically all the hurdles were already cleared. We passed the customs check with little trouble - there couldn't be a greater difference between the check on the China side and on the Kyrgyz side. Here, the immigration officer took my bag, opened it, glanced inside, patted around and gave the all-clear sign in the span of 10 seconds. They probably don't bother with an intensive check as they know that there is no way on earth someone could smuggle some contraband items through the Big Brother of China.

## In Kyrgyzstan

Now, we were a merry band of 6, trudging past the Kyrgyz customs and coming to a road where several people, who seemed to be taxi drivers, were gathered. A guy from Tajikistan soon joined us and there began a spirited back-and-forth session of price negotiation for a taxi ride to Osh, involving several miming actions and the frequent utilisation of the phone Calculator app. Of course, having the Tajik guy around was a huge bonus, given that he could speak some Kyrgyz. After a protracted haggling session, the final price was set at 1200RMB for 7 of us, which works out to ~170RMB/person - we were totally fine with that!

*Haggling session in progress*

We proceeded to board our 6th vehicle of the day **(Time upon leaving for Osh - 5:50pm)**. And so began the adventures of the crazy Kyrgyz driver (the man in the middle of the above photo). The old man was navigating the winding and curvy mountain roads at ridiculous speeds of 90km/h. It had all the elements of a rollercoaster ride - being thrown from side to side, a definite sense of danger (the car was in terrible condition; half the windscreen was cracked) and, also, fantastic views. The customs was situated at about 3000m altitude, but the road leading out from the customs just kept going up for the first part. 3500m, 3600m, 3700m, 3800m... As we got higher and higher, the landscape kept on becoming increasingly dramatic. Before we knew it, we were surrounded on both sides by huge snow mountain ranges. The views were absolutely stupefying, jaw-dropping, magnificent. It evoked a sense of wonderment; never had I ever seen such a view.

We continued to be treated to one of the most nerve-wracking car rides of my life, as the old man swerved left and right to navigate the winding roads, sidestep potholes and avoid stray animals (which was a common sight). One incident was particularly memorable. A car had cut out from a minor road into his path, causing him to brake hard. He duly decided to exact some revenge and kept a constant honk at him for 2 minutes, tailgating him relentlessly, even following the offender onto a side road which was clearly not our route (he reversed out of the side road shortly after). We were chuckling in disbelief from the back - never ever piss off an angry old Kyrgyz driver.

At a town called Sary-Tash, midway between the border and Osh, we stopped at a mama shop equivalent to purchase some snacks and have a walkabout. For some inexplicable reason, our driver bought a can of beer, downed it and henceforth rendered himself incapable of driving. So, the Tajik guy took over the driving duties instead. ?????? For the next 2 hours, our driver just KO-ed in the front seat, till the point where he was half-sprawling on the gearbox and the Tajik guy had to shove him back into his seat. It was an absurd situation.

*Rest stop at Sary-Tash*

After a gruelling 4+-hour journey, which involved passing by numerous herds of animals on the roads, we finally reached our hostel in Osh. The time at which we reached was 8:30pm, however we had gained 2 hours travelling from GMT+8 to GMT+6, so in actual fact, it was **10:30pm**. In other words, we had spent a solid 14 hours on the road, from our hostel in Kashgar to our hostel in Osh. Upon checking in, we spent a while just lying prone on the floor, reflecting on the utterly ludicrous adventures of the day and revelling in the fact that we had actually made it. 14 hours, 6 vehicles, 1 unforgettable border crossing.
