I was in Munich during my exchange semester when I went for this expedition, fully taking advantage of the cheap intra-Europe flights via the ludicrously cheap budget airlines Ryanair and WizzAir. My outbound and inbound flights from/back to Germany were:

1. 15th Jun 2017, Memmingen to Sofia
2. 26th Jun 2017, Belgrade to Memmingen

Upon leaving Munich, there had only been 1 item booked - an Airbnb in Sofia for 4 nights. Everything else for the next 8 days was still up in the clouds, as long as we were at Belgrade Airport by the morning of 26th Jun to catch the return flight.

This was, however, not due to lackadaisical planning. Instead, it was simply because it was tremendously difficult to find information online on inter-city travelling in the Balkans region. The little information that could be procured was either (i) outdated, (ii) dubious or (iii) in an incomprehensible language that not even Google Translate could help much in.

## Mission plan

The initial plan after Sofia was to head up to Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina. As the crow flies, it was a distance of less than 600km, but as I later came to realise, there is no such thing as a straight-flying crow in the Balkans. It is either inhibited by the geography of the area, the poor road infrastructure or the iffy inter-country politics.

We had managed to identify 2 possible options by which we could make this arduous journey, but again, they were only tentative options for the reasons mentioned in the previous paragraph.

1. Sofia -> bus to Skopje -> bus to Prishtina -> bus to Sarajevo
2. Sofia -> bus to Niš -> bus to Novi Pazar -> bus to Sarajevo

The first option had the additional complication of going from Kosovo to Serbia, which does not regard Kosovo as an independent country, but instead still as a part of Serbia. We had read online of people getting detained at the Kosovo-Serbia border for only having a Kosovo stamp in their passport, which they did not recognise and thus constituted unlawful entry into Serbia. There were also recounts of how the Serbian border police would painstakingly cancel out the Kosovo stamp in the passport and replace it with a Serbian stamp, a baffling act of pettiness. However, there were also people who reassured that the border control are much more understanding of the situation nowadays, especially for tourists. Nonetheless, this was not something we would wish to take our chances on.

Due to this quandary, it seemed like Option 2 would be the preferred option. However, this option fell into the "dubious" category; the sole source for one of the bus routes mentioned was a random forum post a few years ago, and there was no way to obtain a confirmed bus timetable from an official site.

All in all, this was a real headache that we decided to postpone solving until we reached Sofia, where we could hopefully get a better idea of the bus routes and find some people that we could consult for advice.

## Flying off from Memmingen Airport

We were flying WizzAir, which only flew from Memmingen Airport, a good 100km away from Munich. Thus, we had to take the Allgäu Express bus from Munich Hauptbahnhof to the airport. The bus ride (15€) cost more than half of the flight ticket itself (25€); it was absurd.

We had stamped our passports and were waiting in the queue to board the plane, when we suddenly stumbled upon a fantastically ridiculous 3rd option for our Sofia-Sarajevo leg. It involved 2 separate WizzAir flights, less than an hour apart:

1. Sofia-Budapest
    - 19 Jun, 8:45am (GMT+2) - 9:10am (GMT+1)
2. Budapest-Sarajevo
    - 19 Jun, 9:55am (GMT+1) - 11:10am (GMT+1)

It was the epitome of a high-risk-high-reward play - any delay on the first flight whatsoever and we would be stuck in Budapest, with literally no way of going from Budapest to Sarajevo (no bus route existed and there were no international trains going into Bosnia). However, if we did manage to pull it off, it would save us a mountain of trouble and free up a couple of days which would otherwise be spent on a bumpy bus ride between Bulgaria and Bosnia.

It was a split-second decision that we had to make then and there, as we were already in the queue waiting to board our plane any moment. We decided to go for it and booked it within 10 minutes. The icing on the cake - the Sofia-Budapest flight cost 10.09€ and the Budapest-Sarajevo flight cost 10.24€, for a grand total of 20.33€!
