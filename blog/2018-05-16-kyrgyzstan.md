Kyrgyzstan is not a well-known country. Probably over 90% of people would have a hard time pinpointing it on a map (and so did I before this trip took place). Everyone simply knows it as one of the -stans that were formerly under Soviet rule and one of the countries in the obscure Central Asia region. Even less people know how to pronounce the name of the country correctly. Kree-gee-stan, ker-ger-stan, krees-stan… the variations are endless. In mainstream media, it is virtually never mentioned as there is nothing extraordinary about the country - no outstanding economy, no prominent sportsmen, no "must-visit" tourist attractions. It is the country that causes people to exclaim "Where is this place?" when they see it being represented in international summits.

Hence, a short summary of the country seems to be in order. Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked country in Central Asia that borders China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. The average altitude of the country is an eye-opening 2700m, with mountains occupying 90% of the country, most prominently the massive Tian Shan mountain range which boasts several peaks beyond 7000m altitude. One of its more famous attractions is the Issyk-Kul lake, one of the deepest and largest lakes in the world which is about 20 times the size of Singapore. Due to the mountainous landscape, less than 10% of the country is populated. Many people lead a rural lifestyle, rearing animals and selling them at livestock markets. English is almost next to useless here as even most of the younger generation do not speak it.

As what seems to be a trend across these less developed countries, we found that the people there were brimming with genuine friendliness and kindness. In our one week there, we met countless people who readily went out of the way to help us out of the goodness of their hearts. It did not hurt that most of the people were gawking at us as we walked down the streets (there was a moment where we walked past a café in Osh and we glimpsed more than half the people inside turning their heads to stare at us through the glass window). It bordered on ridiculousness at times, that we were being regarded as such alien creatures. We indulged their curiosity more often than not, hopefully we left a memorable impression on them too!
