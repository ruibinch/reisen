Sofia is the capital of Bulgaria, famed for its religious diversity and rich cultural history from the heady days of the Ottoman Empire to being part of the Communist Eastern bloc. The city landscape is adorned with cathedrals, synagogues, mosques and Communist-style buildings, framed against the backdrop of the Vitosha Mountains.

## Around Sofia

### Architecture

Sofia has a delightful mishmash of various architectural styles that stood out even to someone like me who is unable to distinguish between the frequently bandied about terms like Victorian, classical, Byzantine, modern or the equivalent words with a neo- prefix, whatever that means.

Thanks to [this site](http://flipfloppeople.com/Architecture-in-Sofia-110) however, I am able to at least to tag a rough style to the buildings that I had come across.

There is the **Regional History Museum**, designed in the *Vienna Secession* style.

The *neoclassical* **Ivan Vazov National Theatre**.

*Tall columns at the front always look aesthetic*

The iconic **Alexander Nevsky Cathedral** in *neo-Byzantine* style.

The *Ottoman-era* **Banya Bashi Mosque**, which looks like a mini-Hagia Sophia.

### Bulgarian food

Bulgarian cuisine features an eclectic mix of seemingly everything, drawing inspiration both from the Balkans region as well as its Persian/Turkish past. We participated in a food tour to get a firsthand experience of the assortment of meat, vegetables and dairy available. They are especially known for their yogurt, which was great in traditional yogurt form. It was also present in soup form, which was... not so great.

*Dubious-tasting yogurt in soup form*

Our guide on the food tour was a Bulgarian girl, likely a few years younger than me. She was a student but was doing this as a means to supplement her allowance. At the same time, she was studying German B2 as she harboured hopes of going to a university in Germany for higher education, as, to paraphrase her, Bulgarian universities are useless. This was a recurring trend which I would see in these Balkan countries, and one which struck me deeply.

After the tours, I went to the central bus/train station to do some preliminary recce for my planned trip to the 7 Rila Lakes the next day, since, in accordance with the trend, I was unable to find a credible source as to the bus/train timings. There were organised trips from Sofia city centre all the way to the Rila Lakes for a price of 40€, but I was adamant on going by myself.

And what a decision it turned out to be.

## A day of madness

I woke up bright and early at 6am, armed with a solid route plan in my head of getting to the Rila Lakes. Train from Sofia to Dupnica -> bus from Dupnica to Sapareva Banya -> minivan up to the Rila Lakes. I approximated 3 hours as my total travel time.

The train ride from Sofia to Dupnica took almost 2 hours, despite the distance being only ~80km, and the train looked like it came right from the 1990s. There was no such thing as a conductor's voice or even an information screen informing on what the next station would be, so I had to closely track my GPS to ensure that I got off at the correct station. Fortunately, I did manage to do so and I walked over to the neighbouring bus station for my next connection.

Problem was, everything was in Cyrillic. Through a combination of matching the Cyrillic letters to the English alphabet and some broken communication with the ticket seller, I was directed to wait for a specific bus at a specific berth at a specific timing of 10am. When it came, I boarded the bus, which looked like it came right out of the 1980s.

![balkans/sofia/20170617_093652.jpg](/img/balkans/sofia/20170617_093652.jpg)
*A bunch of timings and a bunch of intelligible characters*

It was an uneventful ride until the driver announced "Sapareva Banya", where I duly alighted. And immediately, I felt it. The town was already at an altitude of 1000m and it was a chilly and rainy 18°C. I was wearing a short-sleeved shirt and jeans, with no jacket, as I had naively thought that it would be a nice warm summer day (it was the middle of June after all). I debated on abandoning the trip, since the weather forecast indicated more rain to fall in the next couple of hours.

But, on the other hand, I had woken up at 6am and been travelling for a good 2+ hours to a remote town 100km from the capital. It would be a huge waste to turn back now.

The town of Sapareva Banya had been mentioned as a place where a connecting minivan could be taken to go up to the lakes, but there was absolutely zero indication on where I could make my next connection; it seemed like I had been dropped off at a random bus stop along a random street in the almost-deserted town.

I went to seek help as well as temporary refuge from the rain at a nearby coffee shop. It was a struggle to get my point across but after using a combination of hand gestures and Google Translate, the lady owner eventually understood my intention. She made a phone call and, within a minute, a man appeared out of the blue offering a ride. I was utterly perplexed on how the system worked there. 

He drove up a mountain road for about half an hour till we reached a fork in the road, where I disembarked and was told to follow the upward fork till I reached the place. I got off and looked around me. It was just trees and a few huts in the distance, with no sign of other forms of transport whatsoever. I wondered, "How on earth am I going to get down later?" But, that was a problem to be solved later; in the meantime, I had some lakes to visit.

![balkans/sofia/20170617_114437.jpg](/img/balkans/sofia/20170617_114437.jpg)
*The dark blue sign in the middle translates to "Rilski Ezera", or Rila Lakes*

I walked up the abovementioned path and came across some signs of life – quite a few minivans and cars, and then the chairlift that would bring me up from 1585m to 2100m altitude. As I bought my chairlift ticket, I spotted some ponchos at the shop and contemplated buying one just in case. But I decided, "Nah, the poncho has no hood anyway so it won't be that useful". Mistakes were indeed made.

![balkans/sofia/20170617_115324.jpg](/img/balkans/sofia/20170617_115324.jpg)
*How did I see this foreboding sign and still decide not to buy a poncho?*

The chairlift was, to say the least, dubious-looking. Without question, it would have failed all possible safety regulations had it existed in Singapore. It was a seat with an overhead bar that I had to pull down over me to avoid falling over into the forest below. The catch was that I had to hold on to the bar, as it would casually float back up once released. And no such thing as a seatbelt existed. Nevertheless, the bright side of having no cumbersome safety mechanisms meant that I had a fantastic unimpeded view of my surroundings. The chairlift slowly plodded up for about 20-30 minutes. It got colder and colder and I really started regretting not bringing a jacket.

![balkans/sofia/20170617_120737.jpg](/img/balkans/sofia/20170617_120737.jpg)
*View from the chairlift*

I got off the chairlift at the top, where a sign informed me that it was indeed 2100m altitude. And the hiking part hadn't even started yet! The surroundings looked bleak and desolate, with the sky a dull shade of grey and barely a soul in sight.

![balkans/sofia/20170617_122236.jpg](/img/balkans/sofia/20170617_122236.jpg)
*Start of the hike*

![balkans/sofia/20170617_122231.jpg](/img/balkans/sofia/20170617_122231.jpg)
*Where I came from, with the chairlift in the distance*

The idea of the 7 Rila Lakes was that one would trek up from 2100m and gradually see the lakes one by one. Upon reaching the peak at 2500m and turning around, all 7 lakes would be viewed in all its glory in one perfect picturesque scene. I prayed hard that this image would become a reality as I started my hike up.

However, the sky had other plans. As I began my trek, the grey sky got more ominous and large clouds began appearing in the distance. I cursed but resolved to make it as far as possible before turning back if need be. There were barely any other hikers besides me, making for a serene and peaceful scene. Massive sheets of ice decorated the surrounding mountains. I had been walking up for about 45 minutes and had seen 3 out of the 7 lakes.

![balkans/sofia/20170617_124636.jpg](/img/balkans/sofia/20170617_124636.jpg)
*2 out of the 7 lakes, as well as the incoming fog*

And then, all hell broke loose. A fog started rolling in (previewed in the above picture), limiting my visibility to about 100m. A drizzle began, which gradually increased in strength till it became a full storm. A merciless wind kicked up, sending the rain in all directions. Nevertheless, I still relentlessly continued on for a few more minutes until it reached the point where I realised that I really had to turn back else I might freeze to death. Because I had walked up for 45 minutes, I now had to spend 45 minutes walking back down. And it was probably one of the worst 45 minutes of my life.

![balkans/sofia/20170617_125423.jpg](/img/balkans/sofia/20170617_125423.jpg)
*Right before the literal storm*

As I retraced my steps down, the scene around me was something to behold. The rain came down in sheets, the omnipresent cold wind was howling and the fog made the surroundings reminiscent of an apocalyptic wasteland. I was the only person in my entire 360-degree field of vision, surrounded by nothing but green grass and white fog. The wind battered my left side and I felt my left ear slowly numbing. My exposed arms were completely soaked. I stuffed my hands into the pockets of my jeans and trudged down through the elements, a picture of helplessness. I met a couple of groups of people on my way down who were still headed upwards, but who were fully decked out in jackets, hoods and ponchos. Some of them smiled incredulously at me as I strode past them with not a single protective layer of clothing; I could only reply with a wry grin.

After what seemed like a small eternity, I glimpsed the hut below me, which signified the start of the hike. Utter relief swept over me; by then, my left ear was completely numb, my clothes were soaked and I was shivering uncontrollably. But the ordeal was not yet over – I had to descend down a winding, rocky path before I reached the bottom. It was a harrowing few minutes as I moved at a turtle's pace down the slippery and wet rocks, and I thankfully managed to make it to the bottom without falling. Once I was on flat ground, I made a beeline for the hut. I glimpsed the temperature display outside the hut – 7°C. And I was just wearing a short sleeved shirt and jeans.

The hut was quite a large place; it had rooms for travellers and a large café which served as a gathering area for the hikers. I burst in, cold, wet and dripping. I desperately wanted to dry myself off but that was easier said than done, given that I had no towel with me. I resorted to using the toilet paper in the toilet, which was about as effective as using a spoon to collect water from a pond. But, beggars can't be choosers, and I had literally no alternative option. I used half the toilet roll before I realised its futility and gave up. I proceeded to the café and got myself a cup of hot tea. And then another, and then another. I spent the next 45 minutes drinking cup after cup of hot tea and hot chocolate, as I continued shivering in my wet clothes. It was an absolutely terrible feeling.

![balkans/sofia/20170617_142105.jpg](/img/balkans/sofia/20170617_142105.jpg)
*My view in the café of the hut for 1.5 hours, half of which was spent shivering*

After I had warmed myself up somewhat sufficiently, I got myself a proper lunch from the café. As I attacked it ravenously, I reflected on what the day had been so far. I had woken up at 6am, taken a train, a bus, a minivan and a chairlift up to the mountains, where I had hiked up for a while before proceeding to get completely destroyed by the elements, and then finding my way back down to seek refuge in a hut. But, the story was only half written. I was still 2100m above sea level and 100km away from my accommodation, with no plan whatsoever for my return journey. Never mind, one step at a time – I first had to fill my stomach. I went to order a second helping.

Once I felt brave enough, I stepped out into the outdoors again. And I promptly began shivering again; the rain had stopped but a gentle wind still persisted, which was enough to chill me (my clothes were still wet after all). The surroundings still looked breathtaking, but my extent of appreciation for it was inhibited by the fact that I was shivering throughout the entire duration of the chairlift ride.

It was then time to deal with the elephant in the room that I had been pushing to the background till then – how on Earth was I going to get back to the city? As I walked past the rows of minivans and cars, I considered the possibility of hitchhiking, but there was no one around me who was leaving at that moment. I returned back to the fork where I had disembarked and spotted a tour bus in the distance, where some people were boarding. I hurried over and prayed hard that I could somehow get a seat on it back to civilisation.

Unfortunately, the bus driver spoke minimal English. Fortunately, he spoke some decent German which I could follow. But unfortunately, he informed me that the bus was only for members of the tour package. Nevertheless, he brought me over to one of the nearby huts, where we came across a group of oldish Bulgarian folks in their 50s and 60s, sitting around a wooden table and drinking beer. He conversed with one of the men in the group in Bulgarian; thankfully, the man spoke somewhat decent English and confirmed with me that I was looking to go back to Dupnica, the first town where I had taken the train to. He then called someone on his phone and quoted me a price of 30lv (15€). It was quite a steep price but at that point in time, my demand could not be more inelastic; I would have readily agreed even if it had cost 100€.

The waiting time would be 45 minutes and he invited me to take a seat with them, buying me a cup of tea in the process. In addition, I bought a bottle of beer too for the princely sum of 2lv (1€). I reflected on the absurdity of the situation – somehow, I was drinking a beer with 5 Bulgarian folks in a random hut in the Rila Mountains in central Bulgaria. I chatted to the old Bulgarian woman sitting beside me in an varied mix of broken English and German. She informed me that the tea I was drinking was brewed from the leaves of a plant growing just about 10m from where I was sitting. It was one of the more bizarre experiences of my life, to say the least.

![balkans/sofia/20170617_154648.jpg](/img/balkans/sofia/20170617_154648.jpg)
*My companions for the hour; I had sought refuge inside the hut temporarily for some warmth*

![balkans/sofia/20170617_152545.jpg](/img/balkans/sofia/20170617_152545.jpg)
*A memorable beer*

A while later, the man's phone rang and he informed me that my taxi had arrived. I thanked them profusely and left the cosy confines of the hut. The taxi driver was another massively kind soul who chatted with me throughout the ride. The journey passed by in the blink of an eye. Soon, I was back in Dupnica, where I was only a single train/bus ride away from the city. The driver kindly informed me on the timing and berth of the next bus back to Sofia – bless him.

The shower that I took upon returning to the Airbnb was, most definitely, one of the best showers ever. All in, I had spent about 30€ for the travelling, which was only about 5-10€ cheaper compared to the tour package. But, some experiences are indeed priceless.

## Last day in Bulgaria

The weather the next day was a brisk 12°C and I got some minor PTSD from the misadventures of the previous day as I left the Airbnb and stepped out into the open. Since I had already fulfilled my quota for adventure the previous day, I simply strolled aimlessly around the city the entire day, doing normal touristy stuff and eating lots of food.

I did come across a rather poignant scene as I was sitting in a hotel café having my teabreak. There was an old British couple sitting infront of me conversing in the Queen's English, exuding posh and class and constructing a picture of opulence. Then, an old, ragged-looking Bulgarian woman shuffled in. She definitely had no way of paying for the food at such a place but she received a plate of cake and a drink upon sitting down; it was most likely some form of pre-arranged agreement. As I looked at these two groups of people of similar ages framed in my field of vision, I reflected upon their disparate fortunes and the starkly different lives that they had likely led. *C'est la vie*.
