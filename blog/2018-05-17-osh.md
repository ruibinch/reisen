After our hostel debacle in Kashgar, our hostel in Osh felt like a suite at the Ritz. The receptionist was warm and friendly, the ambience was beautiful, our room was spacious and the toilet was clean (bless!!). It felt heavenly to be able to rest in a place that was warm and clean. Yet another plus point was that I could finally stop using Wechat - no more Great Firewall of China!

However, to paraphrase the proverbial saying, when one problem is solved, another one rears its head. After checking in to the hostel following our 14-hour border crossing journey, we went for dinner at a nearby restaurant, opened the menu and, bam, it was all written in Cyrillic - the language barrier hit us right in the face. We called on the waitress for some translation assistance, but she did not know English. She then called on a young girl, but it turns out that she also did not know any English. In the end, we resorted to Google Translate - we pointed at a dish in the menu, the girl typed it into Google Translate and we read the translated English words. Eventually, as long as it was something meat-related, we were all for it (we were ravenous after having eaten minimally the entire day). Thankfully, the food was pretty good!

## Exploring the city and the bazaar

We were staying for 2 nights at our Osh hostel, but we only had 1 day in Osh, given that we only reached at night on the first day and were flying off to Bishkek in the morning of the third day. Thus, we had to capitalise on that one day to see all we could see.

It was a gloomy and rainy day when we set off from the hostel in the morning, with the temperature a brisk 14C. One of my first impressions of the city was the ridiculous number of potholes, both on the roads and on the pavements. Due to the early-morning rain, the potholes were all filled with rainwater; I felt like Mario as I walked down the street, skipping over pothole after pothole, trying my best to avoid submerging my shoes. Nevertheless, it did not detract from the moment. I had previously read about the bazaar in Osh, which stretches for kilometres along the river running through the middle of the city, and pinpointed it as a "must-visit" place. Indeed, it did not disappoint. The bazaar was as traditional as it gets, with locals selling all kinds of stuff that could be sold and not a single tourist in sight (with the obvious exception of us). I revelled in my purchase of 1kg of the sweetest strawberries I had ever eaten for a ludicrous price of S$1.60.

Similar to the dinner of the previous day, our lunch ordering process was a case of hit-and-hope, especially so given the non-existence of visual aid in the menu. How I decided my order was like this - I pointed at an arbitrary string of Cyrillic characters, the waitress mimed a noodle slurping motion and I decided "yup that looks good". It was a variation of Schrödinger's cat, where we never really knew what we were going to eat until the dish appeared in front of us.

## Eliza

Our travelling habits continued to be in keeping with our surrounding environment - we had a preposterously long lunch, followed by a placid stroll along the city streets.

After our extended afternoon stroll, we were weary and seeking for a place to rest and chill before dinner. As we were ambling along the streets, one café caught our eye - Salvador Café. It looked warm, comfortable and inviting. We heeded its beckoning.

The inside of the café did not disappoint as well. It was nicely furnished with warm lights and an abundance of seats all around. We settled into one of the plush sofas with a sigh of satisfaction; it was nice and comfortable indeed. As we looked around our surroundings, we spotted a young and pretty waitress who couldn't be older than 20. When she came over to take our order, we realised that her English proficiency was pretty good; definitely the best compared to the other Kyrgyz people that we had encountered that day. We attempted to strike up some smalltalk with her, to which she politely responded with a warm smile but the conversation did not persist long. Nonetheless, we seemed to also be objects of interest from their perspective, as the other waitresses and her constantly glanced at us, whispered to one another and giggled.

![casia/osh/20180516_175915.jpg](/img/casia/osh/20180516_175915.jpg)

After we had relaxed enough, as we were leaving the café, we went to have a final chat with her. Then, suddenly, she enquired, "do you have Instagram?". We duly acceded and exchanged further pleasantries - we learnt that her name was Eliza - before making our parting remarks and leaving the café. Our plans were to find a dinner place, then head back to the hostel to wash our clothes and rest early in anticipation of our morning flight the next day.

What happened in reality couldn't have been more different from that initial envision.

As we strolled down the street in search of a restaurant, Isaac suddenly commented: "eh wait, she messaged me". She was asking us on our dinner plans and mentioned that she could come and find us after her shift, which we were keen on as well given that we had no other plans for the night. Our restaurant search became much more simplified now - simply find the nearest restaurant to the café. We entered one that was just a couple of minutes' walk away from the café and proceeded to have our dinner while waiting for Eliza.

True to her word, she arrived about an hour later, right after her shift was completed. We began chatting on the typical introductory stuff, though the content was definitely way more interesting than the norm given that she was an exotic Kyrgyz girl. We learnt that English was her third language, after Kyrgyz and Russian; in fact, she also knew some Korean as she was an avid K-pop fan. She was very interested in learning more about us, our lives and Singapore, which we gladly shared. The fact that we hailed from Singapore attracted others as well - a woman sitting at a neighbouring table leaned over (evidently after overhearing our conversation) and began a short conversation with us out of the blue. It was quite a bizarre scene.

After our dinner was finished, we left and took a stroll down the streets. We had suggested going to another place, where we could simply chill, have a drink and chat together, an idea which she was agreeable to. Along the way, we passed by the looming presence of the Sulaiman-Too Sacred Mountain - it is a mini-mountain located right smack in the middle of Osh that is roughly similar in height to Bukit Timah Hill but occupying a much smaller area. We had walked past it in the daytime but chose not to hike it due to a light drizzle then. She queried if we had been up there, to which we replied in the negative. Her next question was a bombshell - "Do you want to go and climb it now?" Alarm bells rang in my head. It was past 9pm, the entire sky was pitch-black and the summit of the mountain looked even more grim and foreboding; were we going to trust a random girl that we had just met to lead us on a merry hike into the darkness? Isaac was on board with the idea, while I only half-reluctantly agreed; after all, it was better for both of us to go rather than for us to split up.

*Heading to Sulaiman-Too mountain*

So, we diverted our route to head in the direction of the mountain. By then, we were walking blind, as Eliza was the one leading the way. I continued to use Google Maps to assess the direction that we were heading and to maintain some semblance of the geographical surroundings around us. I sporadically turned back to look behind us and ensure that we weren't being followed (on hindsight, this sounds terribly paranoid but I assure that it was wholly justified at that moment). My senses became even more heightened when we crossed the gates at the foot of the mountain itself. The road leading upwards was completely deserted and lightless, with ominous-looking shrubs lining the sides of the roads. It would have been so easy for all this to be a bait, for people to be hiding amidst the cover of darkness, for them to jump out and rob us. We would be completely powerless and at the mercy of our would-be attackers. I shone my phone torchlight in a wide arc left and right repeatedly in an attempt to assuage my fears.

We then reached a point where the road ended and we were faced with the mountain itself. Given that the path onwards was now the rocky trail cut into the side of the mountain, it was much better lit. Additionally, the trail basked in the glow of the lights emanating from the city below us. The shroud of darkness was lifted and I breathed a sigh of relief. I continued the hike with a significantly greater peace of mind.

As we trekked along the trail up to the summit, I realised that there was quite a significant number of people on the mountain, despite the late timing. Groups of people and couples hung out in various places off the trail, enjoying the scenery and the brisk night air. The trail was not hard either; although it involved some clambering onto rocks, we were not posed with any serious obstacles of great difficulty.

Upon reaching the summit, we were greeted with the sight of a huge Kyrgyzstan flag planted atop, gently dancing in the light breeze. We took in the plentiful view offered by this perfect vantage point in the middle of the city. It was indeed a picturesque sight, with the illuminated city laid out in front of us as far as the eyes could see. The weather was quite perfect as well, being a cool 18°C. We revelled in the moment, the spectacle, the fresh air - being at the top of a mountain in the middle of a city, let alone one in the remote region of Central Asia, is not an opportunity that comes knocking very often.

*With our tour guide for the night*

That following night, and in the days and weeks that followed, we often recounted on the memorable events of that night. A complete stranger had chatted with us for a while and subsequently offered on her own volition to bring us up a mountain at night. From her perspective, there could have been reasons to be apprehensive too - we were after all 2 guys and she was a petite 19-year-old girl. I wonder if she had any reservations at all (though it seems like a strong no from the way she acted). Her complete trust in us, the pure kindness of her heart and her desire to showcase more of her city to foreigners was something that touched me deeply. I guess this is what it is when a place hasn't been touched yet by commercialisation, so what outsiders see is really what it is in reality.
