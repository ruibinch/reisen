## Battle plans

During our last night in our Airbnb in Sofia, we laid out our battle plans for the next day. Our flight was departing Sofia at **8.45am (GMT+2)** the next morning and landing at Budapest at **9.10am (GMT +1)**. And, if all went fine and dandy, we would be on another flight departing at **9:55am (GMT+1)** from Budapest. Making the 45-minute transit was ambitious but still within the realms of possibility – our first flight had to leave punctually (no guarantee since WizzAir is a budget airline) and touch down with no hiccups, and we had to be able to quickly clear the Hungarian customs. We began planning the contingency plan in the event of missing our second flight. It was 2 massively divergent paths:

1. If all went according to plan, we would spend 19th-23rd June in Sarajevo, then go to Belgrade from 23rd-26th June, and then fly back to Germany on the 26th
2. If we were to miss the connecting flight, we would be stuck in Budapest. Since there are no international trains connecting to Bosnia, we would have no choice but to take a train to Belgrade. A casual search on the Budapest-Belgrade train threw up a myriad of warnings from various people on ensuring the safety of one's belongings and to be wary of pickpockets. We would then only reach Belgrade on the night of the 19th. Sarajevo was a must-visit destination for me, but that would entail a to-and-fro journey between Belgrade and Sarajevo – a journey which takes 5-6 hours. Since a large part of our time would be spent travelling, the time that we could spend in these cities itself would be cut by almost half as compared to the first option.

It was evident which was preferred.

## Battle time

### Sofia to Budapest to Sarajevo

It was time for the plan to be put into execution. We took an early cab to the airport, wary of the possibility of a morning jam on the highway. Nothing was going to be left to chance that day. We ensured that we were the last ones to board the flight, as we wanted to enquire with the flight attendant on the operating procedure at Budapest Airport. She informed us that we had to take a bus from the plane to the terminal building itself, which was not a good sign. On the bright side, the flight left punctually and the captain broadcasted that the journey would take 1hr 5mins, which would make for an estimated arrival time of **8:50am (GMT +1)**. Hope was alive!

The flight passed by uneventfully. Once the plane landed, we checked the time – 8:50am! As we disembarked from the plane, the stewardess told us "all the best!" – bless her. As we were sitting at one of the last rows, we were one of the first to leave the plane. However, since we had to wait for the bus to ferry us to the terminal itself, we purposely milled around until the bus was about to leave before boarding it, so as to ensure that we were standing by the doors, and subsequently, one of the first to go through immigration. *Kiasu* auntie personified, but lots were at stake.

As luck would have it, there were no flights just before us, so the immigration queue was completely empty. We promptly obtained our passport stamps within a couple of minutes, headed out of the arrival hall, went up the escalator directly to the departure hall and joined another immigration queue – this time on the departing end. The process from bus to arrival hall to departure hall probably took 10 minutes, and it was almost guaranteed that we would be able to make it now. We marvelled at how smoothly everything had gone – the airport gods were definitely smiling down on us that day.

The story was not yet over though; we still had to confirm our accommodation for Sarajevo. While waiting in the immigration queue, I opened my Airbnb app, looked for the accommodation that we had targeted and hurriedly booked it, whilst apologising to the host for the late notification. Amazingly, he replied within 30 minutes, or from the time it took us to get from the immigration queue to the bus transporting us from the terminal to our next plane. Now, finally, everything was settled!

### In Sarajevo

It was actually essential that we had received our host's confirmation before we left Budapest, because once we landed in Bosnia, we were no longer within the EU and our EU data roaming plans no longer worked. I received my 4th passport stamp from a 3rd different country with the same date, which was quite a feat (1 leaving Bulgaria, 1 entering Hungary, 1 leaving Hungary, 1 entering Bosnia). By the time we cleared immigration, it was 11:35am. We checked the schedule of buses departing from the airport and saw that the next bus was slated to leave at 1:30pm, with the previous bus just leaving at 11:30am. What kind of inane schedule was that? Also, there were no trains to the city – in fact, there was no train system at all in the entire capital.

I looked around the hall in the hope of finding an alternative mode of transport and, all of a sudden, spotted my name on a piece of paper that was being held up. I was quite flabbergasted. I went up to the man to enquire but his English was not of a conversational level; instead, he called another man who turned out to be our Airbnb host - he informed us that he had taken the liberty to charter a taxi that would bring us right to the doorstep of the Airbnb! What an absolute angel. Off we went to the city, and to our Airbnb.

Our host was waiting expectantly for our arrival and he was a true saint – he welcomed us graciously, gave us a detailed walkthrough of the place, provided us a list of the best eating places and then even offered to wait for us to wash up so that he could ferry us down to the city centre. During the car ride, he pointed out notable points of interest to us and then dropped us off along a street after giving us pinpoint directions to a restaurant that he had recommended, which we followed to the letter.

As we savoured our lunch, basking in the sun of Sarajevo, we recapped on the day's happenings so far – we had woken up at 6am, taken 2 flights, crossed 3 cities and it was not even 1pm yet! Truly, it was an experience to remember fondly and treasure.
