Of course, our experiences did not simply comprise of security scanner after security scanner (although that was a disproportionately large component). We were treated to wonderful displays of the natural scenery and the surprisingly good food that we found in Ürümqi. And, of course, we met the China MILFs - one of the more memorable groups of people that we encountered on the trip.

## In Ürümqi

While we were strolling around the city and being molested by various security guards, we stumbled upon an unassuming street, which turned out to be a treasure trove of great food. 奶茶 *(milk tea)*，酸奶 *(sour milk)*，红烧牛肉面 *(beef noodle soup)*, egg tart - the food was quite something, especially when we didn't expect it. There was also a small shop selling milk tea near our hotel that we visited on the first night and fell in love with; we would go back there again the next 2 nights while we were in Ürümqi. Unfortunately, the food in Kashgar was not as great...

## 天山天池

On our second day there, we did a day trip to 天山天池 (literally Heavenly Lake) - a lake situated in the mountains 100km away from the city. As with virtually all transportation in that region, it was not a straightforward journey. In total, it comprised of 3 parts (excluding the cab to and from the bus station in Ürümqi):

1. Bus from UrÜrümqi to Fukang
1. Minivan from Fukang to 天山天池 gate
1. Bus from 天山天池 gate to the lake itself

The bus to Fukang was old and dusty with air-conditioning that was barely working; the minivan from Fukang wasn't much better either. Once we were far out from the city, the difference in the conditions was stark. The surroundings were a patch of brown and vehicles kicked up a cloud of dust as they traversed along the sandy and semi-paved roads. There was a moment when the bus came to a full stop along the highway, causing me to wonder on the probability of encountering a traffic jam in such a remote area. Turns out that there was no jam; it was a huge pothole in the road which necessitated all vehicles to slow down to 10km/h to successfully navigate it and avoid any detriment to their own vehicle.

*Bleak and sandy*

Naturally, the prevalence of the security scanners is not restricted within the city. Halfway through our bus journey, we were instructed to alight and go through a full-fledged security post that was not dissimilar to a typical immigration post (except that there was no border in this case). In addition to the scanner, the locals had to scan their ID and be registered by a facial recognition software to clear the security check. We took a considerably longer time to clear it, as an officer was busy jotting down our passport details, handphone number and our reasons for being there. A young-looking officer, upon learning that we hailed from Singapore, asked inquiringly: "你有新加坡的钱给我换吗? *(do you have any Singapore currency to exchange?)*" Unfortunately, I had to dash his hopes and reply "对不起，我没 *(sorry, I don't)*".

After paying a semi-exorbitant entry fee of RMB215 to enter the 天山天池 compound, we were treated to a bus ride involving 20+ hairpin turns right beside the cliff as it steadily plodded up a huge mountain. Sometimes, there was an oncoming bus on the other side of the road; to accommodate it, our bus driver drive right to the absolute edge of the cliff. I looked down and my heart jumped into my mouth; I was happy being the passenger and not the driver here.

Finally, after a semi-gruelling 1.5-hour journey, we reached our destination - 天山天池, which was situated at 1900m altitude. The first impression of the place was "wow it's a really pretty lake". The second impression was "wow there are really a lot of China tourists". Despite the magnificent sight of the lake and the mountains in the background, the place was a little too crowded for my liking. Throughout the hour plus that we spent there, the ratio of China people to foreigners was probably 1000:2; the two of us being the sole foreigners.

## 大盘鸡 in 吐鲁番

The next day, we headed to Turpan, a city 200km away from Ürümqi. It was famous for being a massive grape-producing area as well as being located in the similarly named Turpan Depression, 154m below sea level. It was readily accessible via the 高铁 (high-speed rail), a brisk 1.5-hr ride.

However, we made our first mistake of the trip. The ticket sale closed 15 minutes before the departure time, which was at 11:35am. We reached the station half an hour before, which should have been sufficient. Except that we overlooked one major point in Xinjiang... the security checks. We went through multiple security scanners, passport inspections, patdowns; I even had to take a sip from my water bottle to prove that the liquid was indeed water and not some toxic chemical. By the time we cleared all the checks, it was exactly 15 minutes prior. When we rushed to the counter, we found that we had just missed the deadline by a couple of minutes. There was no choice but to suck it up and wait 2 hours for the next train.

Turpan indeed lived up to its title as the hottest point in China - it was a blazing 37°C when we reached the station. As we were exiting the station, we encountered another security check which entailed inspections of our passports. For some reason, we were classified as suspicious and were escorted to the nearby police station. Eventually, after 20 minutes of waiting around in the suffocating weather, we were questioned, had our passports photocopied and a closeup photo of us taken. I wondered how many photocopies of our passports were currently floating around the collective group of police stations in Xinjiang.

*Turpan train station*

Near the train station, we chanced upon a helpful tour guide who listened to our planned itinerary for the day and dispensed advice accordingly. Ultimately, we just took his advice and hired him as our tour guide for the day. By then, it was already 3pm so we could only visit 2 places at a comfortable pace - 火焰山 and 交河古城. 火焰山 translated to English was "Flaming Mountains", and it definitely lived up to its name. I thoroughly regretted my decision to wear jeans. There was a giant thermometer measuring the ground temperature and the mercury was at 65°C. I overheard a tour guide commenting that it goes up to 85°C during summertime and that an egg could literally be cooked on the surface. No thanks.

We continued on to our next stop, 交河古城 (Jiaohe Old City), which was the ruins of an ancient city dating back 2000 years ago. The ruins itself was a complete maze. In fact, I lost Isaac for a good part of the time we were inside. I had simply continued walking on and on, while he was taking photographs of the surroundings, until I turned back and realised that he was completely gone. At that moment, I shrugged it off and continued on my trek to the end of the ruins. After turning back, the worry escalated as I realised the massive size of the entire area, as well as the high walls along the pathways which severely obstructed my vision. By then, all the other tour groups had left as well and I found myself completely alone in the maze of ruined dwellings. After an extended period of time, I finally found him on the back of a bicycle - he had gone to seek help from a guard, who was pretty worried about my situation. Seems like getting lost inside the ruins was a more serious problem than I had thought.

*From a vantage point*

Our tour guide then brought us to our dinner place and ordered the famous 大盘鸡 for us. It was, as the name suggested, a big plate of chicken. In fact, a massive plate of chicken. It was cooked with a massive amount of oils and spices that was as flavourful as it was sinful. By the end of it, we were completely stuffed. Not learning from our mistake in the morning, we got a bit complacent regarding the timing and almost missed the train ticket booking time for the second time in a day. The severity of missing this train would have been much, much worse as it was the last train of the day. And Ürümqi was a good 200km away. And we had a morning flight to catch the next day. It would have made for a great story, but I was thankful that it did not materialise.

## Xinjiang airport security

Ürümqi Airport offered one of the more memorable airport experiences, for the same reason that makes Xinjiang infamous - the security. The security scanner alone took 15-20 minutes to go through. We were instructed to remove our belts and shoes, as well as an assortment of items from our luggage - electrical items, anything that resembled a liquid, and whatever else that drew the ire of the security staff. My bag was scanned once, then I was asked to remove some offending items, then scanned a second time, then asked to remove even more offending items and then finally, the monster in the shape of the security scanner was slain on the third try. Virtually no one around managed to pass this challenging task on the first attempt.

My Powerbank was one of the items that was identified as contraband, due to the fact there was no voltage written on it. When I asked the security officer on why it was not accepted, given that it had passed the checks at Chongqing Airport with no issue, he simply replied that Xinjiang security was tighter. He kindly offered me the chance of checking it in, but as I didn't deem the Powerbank to be that necessary and not possessing much sentimental value, I decided against the hassle.

With that, we bid farewell to Ürümqi. However, that was not the end of the Xinjiang security; the opposite of that, actually. Kashgar security was even more intense, more ridiculous and more suffocating.
