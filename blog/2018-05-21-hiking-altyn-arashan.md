The main hike that we were planning to do in Karakol was to go up to Altyn Arashan, an alpine valley area situated up in the mountains at 2500m altitude, an approximately 800m ascent from ground level. We had initially considered going to Ala-Kol, a beautiful lake situated at 3500m and further up from Altyn Arashan, but we learnt that it would be a 2-day hike and that the snow there would likely not have melted yet, thus it would be dangerous for us to embark on that ascent without proper equipment.

## Heading up

We set off bright and early in the morning to take a taxi to the starting point of the hike. The taxi driver asked us on the time that we would want him to come back to fetch us; we told him 7pm. I was in slight doubt on whether he would actually bother to return 10 hours later for us (but he really did, bless him).

From the starting point, it would be a 14km walk up to Altyn Arashan. Let's go!

*A welcome sign confirming that it is indeed a 14km hike*

The first part of the hike was a normal, flat path. Of course, it was accompanied with a stupendous view, but that had already been taken as the status quo by then given where we were in the world.

*Starting on our 14km journey*

The first part lasted for only about 10 minutes. The path sloped down after that into a valley.

When we reached the valley area, we were joined by the rushing sounds of a fast-flowing river. This was to be our view for the next hour, with the trail on the left and the river on the right.

After an hour-plus of walking along the river on flat ground, the path sloped upwards. What a sight the sky was.

Our trail was still adjacent to the river, but now we were at a higher elevation.

Soon after, the river was no longer visible from sight.

We witnessed a bizarre sight of horses lounging on the grass in the midday sunshine. They gave absolutely zero hoots about our presence.

*Siesta time*

There was an abundance of sheep as well.

The final part was a steady upslope where we had to lean forward with every step to counteract the pressing effects of gravity. Lactic acid burned in the thighs and regular breathing became panting.

When we reached the top, we were greeted with a stunning view over the entire Altyn Arashan valley. We had made it!

The wooden table in the above picture served as our picnic spot for us to eat our bread and biscuits that we had brought along with us. Safe to say, it was one of the better picnic views of my life.

After we finished our picnic, we headed down to the valley itself. There was a decent number of guesthouses there; I half-regretted not choosing to spend a night up there, it would have been an amazing experience to stay overnight in such a place.

*Yurts and guesthouses (or yurts which were guesthouses)*

We did proceed for a soak in a hot spring. That was one of the main features of the area, where the thermal springs were said to be able to cure various ailments and had numerous health benefits. It cost 200 som, which was about S$4 - definitely worth it.

We soaked for about an hour-odd and decided it was enough. I have no idea if it indeed helped to cure my ailments, but I was definitely refreshed by the water. It felt amazing to wash myself free of the sweat and subsequently step out of the hot spring back into the cool ~15C weather in the valley.

With that, we bid goodbye to Altyn Arashan. It was time to take the long walk back down.
